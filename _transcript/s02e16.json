Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But in many ways that was a precursor to large language models because we had linguists and everything working with us going through the grammar and were doing it

Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so we used to do a lot of usability testing and I designed a protocol for doing that and actually won an award from IBM for my efforts there, which was kind of fun.","startTime":"04:47","endTime":"04:59","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And.","startTime":"04:59","endTime":"04:59","speaker_name":"Marcus

for.","startTime":"05:27","endTime":"05:31","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So they were very keen on also making software based on usage.","startTime":"05:31","endTime":"05:39","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you know, if you had a huge installation of CAD stations and so on, then you would only be billed for the amount of usage and computing power that you used.","startTime":"05:40","endTime":"05:50","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Which I suppose for IBM was really going back to its origins.","startTime":"05:50","endTime":"05:54","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Well, that's mainframe.","startTime":"05:55","endTime":"05:56","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Mainframe thinking, right?","startTime":"05:56","endTime":"05:57","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Exactly, yeah.","startTime":"05:58","endTime":"05:59","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Which is kind of what cloud thinking is today as well.","startTime":"05:59","endTime":"06:01","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"True, true, true.","startTime":"06:01","endTime":"06:03","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So then they decided to shut the lab in and because this is when IBM was going through all its kind of, should we say navel gazing.","startTime":"06:05","endTime":"06:14","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What are we about?","startTime":"06:14","endTime":"06:15","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What should we doing?","startTime":"06:15","endTime":"06:16","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Ms. DOS is overtaking OS2 and so on.","startTime":"06:17","endTime":"06:21","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I applied for a job in the UK and joined a company called Logica in Cambridge.","startTime":"06:22","endTime":"06:29","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And that was really exciting because the team in Cambridge was basically very multidisciplinarian.","startTime":"06:29","endTime":"06:35","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we had projects going ongoing for air traffic control systems, natural language interfaces, speech synthesis, and also at the time, of course, 95, 98, which is when mobile phones would be coming to come onto the scene and Netscape and web browsers and all that good stuff.","startTime":"06:36","endTime":"06:59","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And smart cards were also becoming very much part of the game.","startTime":"06:59","endTime":"07:03","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so we basically did a Venn diagram and said, well, surely the sweet spot is Internet, smart cards and mobile phones.","startTime":"07:04","endTime":"07:10","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so we came up with this proposition called Mobile Commerce.","startTime":"07:12","endTime":"07:16","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And went to Barclays and Nortel.","startTime":"07:16","endTime":"07:21","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"This is like WEP days, I guess.","startTime":"07:21","endTime":"07:24","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"No, this is pre web, this is pre wap.","startTime":"07:24","endTime":"07:28","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so basically we had a project go though with cellnet, Nortel and Barclays, whereby basically the phone became your wallet and we proved that we could do all the transactions securely, etc using ussd.","startTime":"07:29","endTime":"07:46","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But the outcome was nobody could decide who owned the customer.","startTime":"07:49","endTime":"07:53","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Was it the bank customer, was it the mobile phones customer or was it Nortel's customer?","startTime":"07:53","endTime":"07:58","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"07:58","endTime":"07:59","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it kind of basically developed into nothing other than being a great technical proof of concept.","startTime":"08:01","endTime":"08:09","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then during that time we also worked with Chris Bonnington.","startTime":"08:10","endTime":"08:15","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We've set him up with a satellite phone and a digital camera and as he was sending K2, he was stopping every now and then and sending pictures back and a little report on how the ascent was going.","startTime":"08:16","endTime":"08:27","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think it was one of the first applications of combining mobile phones and satellite comms.","startTime":"08:27","endTime":"08:32","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then we did another project with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, using the Newton, and that was basically to replace all the paperwork.","startTime":"08:33","endTime":"08:43","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"08:44","endTime":"08:44","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And.","startTime":"08:46","endTime":"08:46","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so there was a really quite exciting time.","startTime":"08:46","endTime":"08:50","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And because of that, because of the work we'd been doing with mobile telephony and so on, they moved me to the Stockholm office again and I ended up basically becoming like the Ericsson account manager.","startTime":"08:50","endTime":"09:03","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And we ended up being creating a consortium together with AU Systems in Lund, Amadeus in Stockholm, SAS and Ericsson for ticketless travel.","startTime":"09:04","endTime":"09:18","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"09:18","endTime":"09:19","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we took one of their prototype phones, which was basically a PDA with a touchscreen, and implemented smart card with it.","startTime":"09:20","endTime":"09:31","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so you would go to your mobile phone, there was an app there, you would book your travel based on what your commitments were and then it would download the ticket, you'd go to the gate, you'd scan the phone that would let you through the gate and then when you arrived in London, it would direct you to your how to get to your Hotel and we also had digital maps and GPS implemented.","startTime":"09:32","endTime":"10:01","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"10:01","endTime":"10:01","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And this is 1998.","startTime":"10:02","endTime":"10:04","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So basically we're living in the future by far.","startTime":"10:05","endTime":"10:07","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because that's, that's today, right, with Apple wallets and all that stuff, right?","startTime":"10:07","endTime":"10:10","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Correct, yeah.","startTime":"10:10","endTime":"10:12","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So, and there's a funny story actually.","startTime":"10:12","endTime":"10:14","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"When we first got the app running, this was going to be like the keynote for a kickoff meeting for the Ericsson executive team out on Sandham.","startTime":"10:14","endTime":"10:27","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so were debugging and debugging.","startTime":"10:27","endTime":"10:30","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I was sitting in my sauna office and for two days straight I kept calling me, is it ready?","startTime":"10:30","endTime":"10:35","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"No, it's not ready yet.","startTime":"10:35","endTime":"10:36","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We still got a few bugs to iron out.","startTime":"10:36","endTime":"10:38","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then midnight the night before the event, we finally got everything sorted out and then I was like, how do I get from Solna to Sandham in four or five hours?","startTime":"10:38","endTime":"10:53","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I just took a chance and drove down to Gamla Stan and by happen chance there was a guy in a speedboat there and I jumped on his boat and said, will you take me to Sandham?","startTime":"10:54","endTime":"11:07","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And he said yeah.","startTime":"11:07","endTime":"11:08","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so I, I paid him and we set off at 40 knots across the water and then we got to the pier in Sandham.","startTime":"11:08","endTime":"11:18","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Then I reached out with this precious, grabbed it and I was having visions of it go pl into the water.","startTime":"11:18","endTime":"11:24","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Fortunately it didn't.","startTime":"11:26","endTime":"11:27","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Oh wow.","startTime":"11:28","endTime":"11:29","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then, and then because of those events, myself and NOWV and a guy called Bank Carlson bank was at Ericsson, a director in one of their mobile divisions.","startTime":"11:30","endTime":"11:47","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"NOWV was at Imperial College, but it also started a company called Dynamical Systems Research and myself, we sat down one day and said, well, it's the dot com era, why don't we just, you know, get a move on.","startTime":"11:47","endTime":"12:03","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we founded Digital Mobility and set up in London and we got things moving quite quickly, raised quite a bit of money and we had an alliance with Guernsey Telecom because at the time in the UK you couldn't roam and you couldn't send SMS, for example, between Vodafone and Cellnet.","startTime":"12:03","endTime":"12:30","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So but if you had a Guernsey Telecom sim you could, so there was a big advantage that, so we put together a package, the Digital Mobility package, which was aimed at high net worth individuals, frequent travelers and so on, which combined travel, banking, telecoms and so on.","startTime":"12:32","endTime":"12:50","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So, and so I being in charge of partnerships and business development then had to go out and form partnerships with the banks and the travel companies and so on.","startTime":"12:50","endTime":"13:00","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And they were all very receptive until we hit the usual snag who owns the customer?","startTime":"13:01","endTime":"13:06","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So nobody seemed to be willing to kind of divvy up the transactions in an equitable way.","startTime":"13:08","endTime":"13:18","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Everybody wanted more than was satisfactory, but we sold it on and were beginning to get results.","startTime":"13:18","endTime":"13:28","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then were about to get an investment of $7 million from Lehman Brothers and at the 11th hour and 59th minute and 59th second, they withdrew from the.","startTime":"13:30","endTime":"13:43","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so were left, you know, what do we do now?","startTime":"13:44","endTime":"13:47","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so we ended up having to basically sell off the assets of the company.","startTime":"13:48","endTime":"13:52","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We sold our communication and Java Applet distribution system to Tencent in China.","startTime":"13:52","endTime":"14:01","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And.","startTime":"14:01","endTime":"14:02","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then what was left we sold to Norway to Shipstead.","startTime":"14:02","endTime":"14:05","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And fortunately I still had my shirt on my back.","startTime":"14:07","endTime":"14:11","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And.","startTime":"14:11","endTime":"14:12","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And shortly after that I joined the GSM association as a technical director and was responsible for mobile phones.","startTime":"14:13","endTime":"14:22","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And that was really interesting, understanding the politics behind how all these operators work together.","startTime":"14:23","endTime":"14:32","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I certainly had an inside track on that.","startTime":"14:33","endTime":"14:36","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so one of the things I was responsible for in my new division was WI FI and Bluetooth technology.","startTime":"14:37","endTime":"14:48","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So the operators were like, is WI fi going to cannibalize our business or can we find a way to collaborate with these new mushrooms of WI FI activity that are popping up everywhere?","startTime":"14:49","endTime":"15:00","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"15:01","endTime":"15:01","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so through 3GPP we came up with a standard which enabled roaming between WI fi and 3G at the time.","startTime":"15:02","endTime":"15:10","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then the same thing with Bluetooth.","startTime":"15:11","endTime":"15:14","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The Bluetooth SIG was very keen to work with the operators to find application areas and so on.","startTime":"15:14","endTime":"15:22","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And with all the various implementations.","startTime":"15:22","endTime":"15:24","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And again, mobile operators were kind of wary again because of how it might affect their business, rather than seeing it as an enabler, which we are benefiting from right now by having excellent voice communication.","startTime":"15:26","endTime":"15:40","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"15:40","endTime":"15:41","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then I, I was asked to do a press release about Bluetooth technology and Bluetooth Stig, which I did.","startTime":"15:42","endTime":"15:53","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then Vodafone got really upset, so I had to leave the GSM association for some bizarre reason.","startTime":"15:53","endTime":"15:59","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I hadn't got all the right ticks in the boxes.","startTime":"16:00","endTime":"16:02","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But that was no big, big deal.","startTime":"16:03","endTime":"16:05","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Landed a great job with a Swiss company after that called sickba, based in PRI or near Geneva in Switzerland.","startTime":"16:06","endTime":"16:16","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And SIKBA are the world's largest producers of pigments and inks that are used in banknotes and they'd spun off a separate division called Product Security, where they use their know how in pigments and fluorescent pigments to create a technology for preventing counterfeiting and smuggling.","startTime":"16:16","endTime":"16:42","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And this is used actually even today by big brands like Gucci and all those fashion Brands.","startTime":"16:43","endTime":"16:50","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But also we had a.","startTime":"16:50","endTime":"16:52","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"They just landed a project with the Malaysian government to prevent counterfeiting and gray imports of cigarette packets.","startTime":"16:53","endTime":"17:01","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I was made the general manager of the new division in Malaysia and went out there, recruited a team of about 40 guys and girls.","startTime":"17:02","endTime":"17:13","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And the system was based on a, what were they called now?","startTime":"17:13","endTime":"17:20","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Anyway, an inkjet printer that we put in line on the packaging line of the cigarettes.","startTime":"17:21","endTime":"17:26","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you've got these packets of cigarettes flying by hundreds per minute.","startTime":"17:26","endTime":"17:31","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And this inkjet printer had to print the dot exactly in the right spot on the cigarette packet before it was wrapped in cellophane.","startTime":"17:31","endTime":"17:37","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So it's a watermark essentially that's unique to each.","startTime":"17:38","endTime":"17:41","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, so it was a multi level security.","startTime":"17:42","endTime":"17:45","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you had your geometric shape, then you had your fluorescent ink, and then you also had a, if you like, a micromolecule with a very specific 3D shape that Sigma made.","startTime":"17:45","endTime":"18:01","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So this was all part of the ink that was used.","startTime":"18:02","endTime":"18:08","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so the idea, so the, basically it worked like this.","startTime":"18:08","endTime":"18:11","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The cigarette packets went out into the market, then the customs officers had a special little gun which would illuminate this dot and then if it pinged back the right frequency that the reader would give a green light and you would know that it was a locally produced cigarette packet.","startTime":"18:11","endTime":"18:29","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But if it was red, obviously it had been imported from without duty paid.","startTime":"18:29","endTime":"18:33","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so, but of course, like anything, eventually some people will figure out how to analyze the ink and come up with something similar.","startTime":"18:35","endTime":"18:47","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But this, if you like, secret molecule was always the, if you like, the forensic test which would determine whether it was genuine or not.","startTime":"18:47","endTime":"18:55","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then, so we had seven packaging factories in Malaysia, scattered all over the country, jti, Philip Morris, et cetera.","startTime":"18:57","endTime":"19:07","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And we had to distribute the ink.","startTime":"19:07","endTime":"19:11","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So the whole business model was based on, we supplied the equipment, we gave it to them a bit like Tetra Pak business model.","startTime":"19:11","endTime":"19:17","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then the consumption of ink would determine, so how many dots they printed per month would determine the.","startTime":"19:18","endTime":"19:24","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"In.","startTime":"19:24","endTime":"19:24","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"In the revenue that SIGVA would generate from that.","startTime":"19:24","endTime":"19:27","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, interesting.","startTime":"19:28","endTime":"19:29","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then, so then I telemetrized, if you like, all the printers.","startTime":"19:30","endTime":"19:34","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I put a little GSM modem in each one.","startTime":"19:34","endTime":"19:38","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we would be then centrally recording all the dots so we didn't have to go out and take all the numbers off the printers every week or month.","startTime":"19:38","endTime":"19:47","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, and that was a bit.","startTime":"19:47","endTime":"19:48","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And that also enabled us to determine or predict when the printers needed cleaning or maintenance.","startTime":"19:48","endTime":"19:54","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So that went quite well.","startTime":"19:56","endTime":"19:57","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then during that time I got married and my wife was pregnant and Sickba was so impressed with what we'd achieved that they then landed a project in Brazil and they wanted me to go to Brazil to do alcohol and beer bottles.","startTime":"19:58","endTime":"20:13","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But my wife put her foot down and said, no way, Joseph.","startTime":"20:13","endTime":"20:20","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So, so then I was back in the uk.","startTime":"20:20","endTime":"20:26","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I resigned from my work there.","startTime":"20:26","endTime":"20:29","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"They'd given me a fair settlement and I was then looking, trying to think, what do I do now?","startTime":"20:29","endTime":"20:36","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then I went to an alumni meeting for my old school in Rome, St. Stephens, and I bumped into a guy who was about 10 years younger than me, Francesco Cesarini.","startTime":"20:37","endTime":"20:50","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And we got talking and he said, I've just been made redundant from Ericsson.","startTime":"20:50","endTime":"20:55","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I, I used to be part of the Erlang team and I'm starting up a consultancy here and I was like, well, why don't we join forces?","startTime":"20:55","endTime":"21:03","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I mean, I've got a lot of experience working as a management consultant, system integration projects, blah, blah.","startTime":"21:03","endTime":"21:10","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So he said, yeah, let's do it.","startTime":"21:10","endTime":"21:11","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we got an office in Spitalfields and one of the first projects we did actually took me back to Malaysia because I got to know quite a bit of people and had a bit of a network in Kuala Lumpur.","startTime":"21:11","endTime":"21:25","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And one of the guys I knew, Shukri, he was responsible for something called mihas, which was Malaysia's attempt to become, if you like, the center of halal food in the Far East.","startTime":"21:25","endTime":"21:38","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And he said, we really need to find a way to create traceability for halal chicken and halal food.","startTime":"21:39","endTime":"21:47","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So based on, if you like, the work I'd done with mobile telephony and Ericsson and with sigpa, I said, well, I don't see why we can't come up with a system which would enable us to put markings on the chickens and the chicken produce using, if you like, using something similar to what we've done in the past.","startTime":"21:49","endTime":"22:11","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we put together a solution and we presented it to the Malaysian government and so on.","startTime":"22:11","endTime":"22:17","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But then of course, as usual, lots of people want a bit of the pie and so it become an impossible business opportunity to actually execute on.","startTime":"22:17","endTime":"22:27","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But that was kind of fun.","startTime":"22:28","endTime":"22:29","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then so the consultancy started growing, we started getting more.","startTime":"22:30","endTime":"22:36","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So Erlang.","startTime":"22:36","endTime":"22:38","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Erlang was the language that Ericsson used for their system, sorry, Axe systems and their base stations, the GSM base stations.","startTime":"22:38","endTime":"22:50","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And why did they do that?","startTime":"22:51","endTime":"22:53","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because Erlang is, if you like, a virtual machine that is super resilient, very scalable and fault tolerant.","startTime":"22:53","endTime":"23:00","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So, you know, even if base station goes down, it will then reboot and restart.","startTime":"23:01","endTime":"23:06","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And because there was so Many out in the field, Axe exchanges, base stations.","startTime":"23:09","endTime":"23:14","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Despite the fact that basically shut down the Erlang team to its spare skeleton crew, they still needed people to carry on development, coming up with bug fixes and so on.","startTime":"23:15","endTime":"23:27","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we ended up supplying them with consultants to do what they had originally invented.","startTime":"23:27","endTime":"23:32","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And, and so we did a number of different projects and then because of the features of Erlang, we got involved with WhatsApp.","startTime":"23:35","endTime":"23:44","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I don't know if you know WhatsApp is based on Erlang.","startTime":"23:45","endTime":"23:47","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, we got projects with.","startTime":"23:47","endTime":"23:49","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What do.","startTime":"23:51","endTime":"23:51","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You call them now, Vocalink.","startTime":"23:51","endTime":"23:53","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Vocalink is the exchange center for all the clearing banks in the uk.","startTime":"23:53","endTime":"23:59","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So when money is sent from one bank to another, it goes through the vocal link.","startTime":"23:59","endTime":"24:03","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so they had a great big IBM system to do this and they asked us to reverse engineer this to run on Linux boxes using Erlang, which we did successfully and then they sold that to the bank of Singapore.","startTime":"24:03","endTime":"24:18","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So.","startTime":"24:18","endTime":"24:19","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And that went well.","startTime":"24:20","endTime":"24:21","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What other projects did we do?","startTime":"24:22","endTime":"24:24","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We did ticketing systems, gaming systems.","startTime":"24:27","endTime":"24:31","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, it is very versatile language.","startTime":"24:32","endTime":"24:35","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then I was getting to the point where I thought maybe there's something else I want to do in life.","startTime":"24:35","endTime":"24:41","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And we'd been approached by a Danish company called Trifork and Trifork is a Danish system integration company in Copenhagen, but they're actually in Zouk in Switzerland and they're listed on the stock exchange.","startTime":"24:41","endTime":"24:55","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I met the owner of Trifork and he said well, would you be interested in selling your shares to Trifor?","startTime":"24:55","endTime":"25:05","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so we can really helpang expand and so on.","startTime":"25:05","endTime":"25:10","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so yeah, he made me a good offer which I couldn't refuse.","startTime":"25:10","endTime":"25:13","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so I took that on and moved on from there.","startTime":"25:15","endTime":"25:19","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then after that I invested some money in a company called Silent Sensors which I helped co found which was how to make tires smart using, if you like, the beginnings of edge computing.","startTime":"25:19","endTime":"25:32","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So this was because of the legislation requiring TPMS systems in cars and vehicles to monitor tire pressures which are fundamental to basic car safety.","startTime":"25:32","endTime":"25:43","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then I.","startTime":"25:43","endTime":"25:45","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we built up silent sensors over time.","startTime":"25:47","endTime":"25:49","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Originally were using, if you like, an RFID solution which required quite hefty antennas and infrastructure gates and so on, which was a bit of a non starter.","startTime":"25:50","endTime":"26:02","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So then went back to the drawing board and said well, we need to provide our own power source because we at this point we'd managed to interest some major tire companies like Bridgestone and Continental and so were looking at energy harvesting, so we found a piezoelectric solution and then we found a solution for Solid state batteries.","startTime":"26:02","endTime":"26:21","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we created, if you like, a plaster or a flexible bit of electronics.","startTime":"26:21","endTime":"26:25","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And were based up in Sedgefield as part of the cpi, the center for.","startTime":"26:26","endTime":"26:32","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What was cpi.","startTime":"26:34","endTime":"26:34","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I can't remember what it stood for.","startTime":"26:34","endTime":"26:35","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But basically they had all the equipment necessary for flexible electronics production.","startTime":"26:35","endTime":"26:41","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"26:41","endTime":"26:42","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we started making prototypes.","startTime":"26:42","endTime":"26:44","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We also interested MRF india and the project went very well.","startTime":"26:44","endTime":"26:51","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But because of the, if you like, the conservative nature of tires, it was necessary for them then to run basically millions of miles with the prototype tires to evaluate and determine that they were safe.","startTime":"26:51","endTime":"27:07","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Not very startup friendly.","startTime":"27:07","endTime":"27:08","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"No, no.","startTime":"27:10","endTime":"27:10","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"There's a sort of.","startTime":"27:10","endTime":"27:11","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The chasm of doom and destruction became insurmountable in some respects in terms of being able to get to a point where the investors felt they were going to get a return on their investment in a reasonable time frame.","startTime":"27:11","endTime":"27:26","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But silent census is still going.","startTime":"27:27","endTime":"27:29","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I kind of browned out.","startTime":"27:29","endTime":"27:31","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I had enough of this and so I sort of said bye.","startTime":"27:31","endTime":"27:35","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Still got shares in the company and they're still going through the motions and perfecting it.","startTime":"27:35","endTime":"27:42","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And maybe in the next decade it will come to light.","startTime":"27:42","endTime":"27:45","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But, but in the course of this, I, I again made a number of very interesting contacts.","startTime":"27:48","endTime":"27:55","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"One of them is Invisa, which is a smart shoe solution, which is basically an activity tracker in your shoe.","startTime":"27:56","endTime":"28:03","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Again using piezoelectrics and solid state batteries for the power source.","startTime":"28:03","endTime":"28:07","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And also because of the solid state battery requirement, I found a company in Poland called the Batteries that can manufacture both the battery and the energy harvester in scale.","startTime":"28:09","endTime":"28:21","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So that's currently what I'm working on.","startTime":"28:21","endTime":"28:23","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"At the same time I'm working with Planet Computers making mobile phones like this one with a keyboard reminiscent of the Scion.","startTime":"28:24","endTime":"28:36","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yes.","startTime":"28:37","endTime":"28:37","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And if you give me one second, I will bring another little prop.","startTime":"28:38","endTime":"28:42","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Hang on.","startTime":"28:44","endTime":"28:45","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, right back.","startTime":"28:45","endTime":"28:46","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"No worries.","startTime":"28:46","endTime":"28:47","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So this is what we call our xr.","startTime":"29:07","endTime":"29:12","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's not powered up now, but basically this is a color touchscreen which you can program and customize to customers requirements or basically as a out of the box solution.","startTime":"29:13","endTime":"29:28","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And we also prototyped some RFID rings which you could use for making transactions and so on.","startTime":"29:29","endTime":"29:37","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Before we dive into that, I want to take a step back and like early days, Planet Computer, like you started with Gemini, maybe like take me back to the early days there.","startTime":"29:39","endTime":"29:49","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So people are not familiar with your kind of product portfolio and your backstory of how you came to be.","startTime":"29:49","endTime":"29:56","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Really like, what was the starting point and kind of what did you set out to do in the first place?","startTime":"29:56","endTime":"30:02","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"30:03","endTime":"30:04","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Well, Basically the whole Planet Computers proposition is based on, if you like, the ergonomics of a keyboard.","startTime":"30:04","endTime":"30:12","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The keyboard is a very efficient way to communicate compared touchscreens or voice communication.","startTime":"30:13","endTime":"30:23","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So.","startTime":"30:24","endTime":"30:24","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And the reason for this was also because the, if you like Imperial College.","startTime":"30:25","endTime":"30:30","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So the founder of Scion was a professor at Imperial College and I didn't know that.","startTime":"30:31","endTime":"30:37","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Oh yeah, yeah, South African got my name.","startTime":"30:37","endTime":"30:41","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I, I can see his face but I can't remember his name, but it'll come to me.","startTime":"30:41","endTime":"30:44","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So NOWV and he became friends and then when Scion basically shuttered because it was overtaken by events and I mean then we can go into the whole story about Symbian and so on and so forth, but they weren't able to, if you like, keep pace with what happened with smartphones and integrate 5G, 4, 3G, 2G into their phone as their PDAs.","startTime":"30:45","endTime":"31:11","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But the basic mechanics and engineering of that PDA was still very valid if one wanted a pocketable PC, if you like.","startTime":"31:12","endTime":"31:23","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So NOWV did a deal and Scion then gave him the rights to continue developing this.","startTime":"31:24","endTime":"31:32","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So in order to get it to market, Planet Computers then did a crowdfunding using Indiegogo, I think, if I remember rightly, and that was successful.","startTime":"31:33","endTime":"31:46","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then they, so we had the Gemini and then we had the Cosmo and then we had the Astro.","startTime":"31:46","endTime":"31:52","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I mean, yeah, and this, what Planet Computers never really achieved was if you like, enough investment to do not just the design, development and production, because as it turns out, mobile operators, they don't want to pay for the marketing, they want to do the distribution and so on, but they don't want to do the marketing.","startTime":"31:53","endTime":"32:19","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So if you want to sell a million phones, you need to have a marketing budget, probably a million pounds to get yourself in front of everybody else.","startTime":"32:20","endTime":"32:29","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then of course we've got the big players like Samsung and Apple and so on, that so huge that they basically the, the effort, if you like, for a mobile operator then to sell these sort of niche phones is the benefit to them financially is insignificant really.","startTime":"32:29","endTime":"32:51","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So they don't really give you much time.","startTime":"32:53","endTime":"32:56","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So yes, you can sell them over the Internet and so on, but you're constantly hitting that crystal ceiling, if you like that glass ceiling in order to get the volumes.","startTime":"32:58","endTime":"33:08","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because then, because the people that are producing it, they don't want to produce 10,000, they want to produce 100,000 or a million a year.","startTime":"33:08","endTime":"33:14","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, they call it Moq Battle, right?","startTime":"33:15","endTime":"33:18","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Correct, yeah.","startTime":"33:18","endTime":"33:20","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we're still Struggling on if you like.","startTime":"33:20","endTime":"33:24","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And we're developing a new version with a better processor, 5G.","startTime":"33:25","endTime":"33:31","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We're also looking at NTNs to make it satellite compatible, et cetera.","startTime":"33:31","endTime":"33:35","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"33:35","endTime":"33:35","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But that's still.","startTime":"33:36","endTime":"33:38","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"If you like.","startTime":"33:39","endTime":"33:40","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But talk to me about.","startTime":"33:40","endTime":"33:41","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because the reason why I think it's interesting is a.","startTime":"33:41","endTime":"33:43","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's kind of carries on scions kind of like initial vision and obviously the form factor obviously which is I guess makes me nostalgic.","startTime":"33:43","endTime":"33:52","speaker_name":"Viktor

mean we spoke about last time with Janko in London.","startTime":"33:56","endTime":"33:59","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like we spoke about some interesting use cases where these devices are being used.","startTime":"33:59","endTime":"34:02","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"34:02","endTime":"34:03","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like they are not necessarily your consumer use case because I think that's obviously a very difficult market to get into and yeah, least from the pricing point of view with MOQ problems.","startTime":"34:03","endTime":"34:15","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But talk to me, what about like the use case guy?","startTime":"34:15","endTime":"34:17","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"He manages.","startTime":"34:17","endTime":"34:17","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I'm not sure how much what you can mention on there, but he mentioned some real interesting use cases for like these applications or application of these phones in the world that you've seen already today and your customers.","startTime":"34:17","endTime":"34:28","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Well, I mean I don't know the most.","startTime":"34:30","endTime":"34:34","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The typical use case is if you like your business user that uses Excel and Word and so on and doesn't want to lug a laptop around with them.","startTime":"34:35","endTime":"34:44","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"He wants something you can stick on the inside pocket of his jacket.","startTime":"34:44","endTime":"34:47","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And from there you've also got a few examples of journalists use them quite extensively.","startTime":"34:47","endTime":"34:56","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"There's some authors that use them quite extensively because it enables them to, you know, when something pops into their head they can just whip it out and write a paragraph or a chapter on the train or wherever.","startTime":"34:56","endTime":"35:06","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So those are the, if you like the typical use cases.","startTime":"35:09","endTime":"35:11","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I mean I would say 95 of anybody that's bought a planet smartphone is.","startTime":"35:11","endTime":"35:17","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Is a male between I guess 40 to 60 years old because of the fact that they either had a BlackBerry or a Scion.","startTime":"35:17","endTime":"35:30","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The, I mean the other use cases are if you like for homeland security and so on because it's multi sim we can customize it with different types of encryption so we have customers in the Far east that use it for their police and so on.","startTime":"35:30","endTime":"35:49","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But that's about, you know, as wild as it gets.","startTime":"35:50","endTime":"35:55","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"No, but the reason why it is interesting I think is.","startTime":"35:56","endTime":"35:58","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Is the multi boot thing is an interesting.","startTime":"35:58","endTime":"36:01","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Oh, you mean.","startTime":"36:01","endTime":"36:02","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, sorry, yeah.","startTime":"36:02","endTime":"36:03","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You mean being able to switch between Android and Linux?","startTime":"36:03","endTime":"36:05","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"No, no, I meant more like the use case for that.","startTime":"36:05","endTime":"36:07","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"36:07","endTime":"36:08","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because that in turn means that there's a very small set of users that would require one such feature.","startTime":"36:08","endTime":"36:14","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"36:14","endTime":"36:14","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that's a very unique proposition.","startTime":"36:14","endTime":"36:16","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think.","startTime":"36:16","endTime":"36:16","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I haven't seen anything out there that has similar functionalities in the same form factor at least.","startTime":"36:16","endTime":"36:22","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"No, no, yeah.","startTime":"36:22","endTime":"36:25","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I mean that uniqueness is perhaps something that should be leveraged more.","startTime":"36:25","endTime":"36:29","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But on the other hand, when customers do require it, they want it in quantity and at this point in time we're just not able to do that.","startTime":"36:29","endTime":"36:39","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, yeah, yeah.","startTime":"36:41","endTime":"36:43","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because that's, I mean from a use case perspective that opens new doors.","startTime":"36:43","endTime":"36:46","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"In particular, I'm thinking I just came back from defcon and like, obviously that's a space where I have a lot of security people there and like being able to just whip out a tablet and boot up tally or whatnot.","startTime":"36:46","endTime":"36:57","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"36:57","endTime":"36:57","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And some Linux distro and like do pen testing on the go on a small device is very covert.","startTime":"36:57","endTime":"37:04","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I guess that's a cool use case for these devices, right?","startTime":"37:04","endTime":"37:07","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Absolutely.","startTime":"37:08","endTime":"37:08","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, yeah.","startTime":"37:08","endTime":"37:09","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But yeah, I mean the whole cyber security thing is again something that we get pulled into.","startTime":"37:10","endTime":"37:19","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But, and that's where the smartphones that we have are part of that solution.","startTime":"37:20","endTime":"37:26","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But also the network appliance that we've developed is also very relevant there in terms of creating a distributed network that is able to, if you like, distribute the computational requirements over a large area.","startTime":"37:26","endTime":"37:42","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And because it's got a lot of media interfaces, camera, audio and so on, we can.","startTime":"37:44","endTime":"37:50","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so the current projects that we have at the moment, we have one in Singapore which is called AI Connect, and that's about using artificial intelligence with CNC machines to improve productivity by monitoring parameters like sound, vibration, heat, power consumption of a CNC machine to determine when the tool is going to wear out.","startTime":"37:50","endTime":"38:18","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because if you can extend the life of that and reduce the number of tool changes, then your productivity goes up.","startTime":"38:18","endTime":"38:26","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But it also addresses the fact that there is a, a growing shortage of skilled machinists in the world.","startTime":"38:26","endTime":"38:34","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Blue collar work is not kind of like top of everybody's list when they're 18 and looking for a job.","startTime":"38:35","endTime":"38:40","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So the idea with the system is that it becomes, if you like, your assistant that tracks your skill level, provides you with feedback, tells you when to change the tool, tells you how to do the configuration and setup.","startTime":"38:41","endTime":"38:58","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so we have the, this appliance that I just showed you and that's hooked up to the PLC of the CNC machine.","startTime":"39:00","endTime":"39:08","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we're collecting all the data and that's also shared with the rest of the factory.","startTime":"39:08","endTime":"39:12","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So the idea is that all the CNC machines in the factory are then connected and then upper management can see what they need to order in terms of just in time flow of parts and consumables.","startTime":"39:12","endTime":"39:24","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But also the idea is if you like a lot of the application of AI and machine learning at the moment means that the time between something happening and something being done about it is actually the latency is quite long because it's the manager that makes the decision, not the machinist.","startTime":"39:24","endTime":"39:46","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Whereas with our solution here, it's the machine machinist that makes the solution on the spot at the time.","startTime":"39:47","endTime":"39:52","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So talk to me more about that.","startTime":"39:53","endTime":"39:54","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you connect to I mean I guess your industrial control system of sorts.","startTime":"39:54","endTime":"39:59","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"39:59","endTime":"40:00","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So maybe a CNC machine, this goes into whole like industry 4.0 kind of movement with preventive maintenance and all that stuff.","startTime":"40:00","endTime":"40:06","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But you have this device that connects one way or another to machinery and then you how what do you go from there?","startTime":"40:06","endTime":"40:13","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Do you have like a mesh network that you.","startTime":"40:13","endTime":"40:14","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because these are oftentimes not very connected environments.","startTime":"40:14","endTime":"40:17","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"40:17","endTime":"40:18","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So because life cycle these devices, machines tend to be meshed in tens or twenties of years rather than software where we have very quick churn.","startTime":"40:18","endTime":"40:29","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"40:29","endTime":"40:29","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So these are my machinery from quite old while that you plug into.","startTime":"40:29","endTime":"40:32","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"40:32","endTime":"40:32","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So talk to me more about what you've seen there, the use cases there because I think that's an interesting one.","startTime":"40:32","endTime":"40:37","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Well yeah, you raised two interesting topics.","startTime":"40:38","endTime":"40:40","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"One is the communication.","startTime":"40:40","endTime":"40:43","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So In Singapore certainly 5G is very prevalent and private 5G networks are growing in popularity.","startTime":"40:43","endTime":"40:50","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we can either use wi fi or 5G.","startTime":"40:51","endTime":"40:54","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"5G offers a lot of features if you like, that WI fi doesn't in terms of security and allocating bandwidth and so on to different assets.","startTime":"40:54","endTime":"41:04","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And the second thing you raised about is if you like second hand machinery can be made smarter with this solution.","startTime":"41:06","endTime":"41:16","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And there's a lot of secondhand machinery that then has a second life.","startTime":"41:16","endTime":"41:22","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then you've got new machines of course which also are a target, but less so if you like for where we are currently with the proposition.","startTime":"41:23","endTime":"41:32","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So the second hand machinery, I mean you could even apply this to machines from 20 years ago because the precision is pretty much the same as machines that are on the market now.","startTime":"41:34","endTime":"41:51","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's just that they've got more servos and more features and so on.","startTime":"41:51","endTime":"41:55","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But yeah, so I mean there's a lot of trade going on.","startTime":"41:56","endTime":"42:01","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so one of the markets we're exploring at the moment is the companies that refurbish these machines and then resell, sell Them and by also offering these add on services they you create if you like value added services which in terms of maintenance and support and so on and making sure they have the right consumables at the right time.","startTime":"42:01","endTime":"42:21","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, I mean what have you, I mean that's the whole industrial system space I find fascinating because it's obviously there's just so much money tied to it.","startTime":"42:22","endTime":"42:31","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"42:31","endTime":"42:32","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because there's obviously entire industries depending on obviously that's the underpinning of these industries at large.","startTime":"42:32","endTime":"42:38","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But have you found like when you plug in these systems I would imagine a lot of his proprietary systems I'd imagine and there probably a lot of reverse engineering of protocols.","startTime":"42:38","endTime":"42:48","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean diversity of protocols can bus is probably involved and so on support.","startTime":"42:48","endTime":"42:53","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like what have you seen in terms of there to actually make this work for all the nerds out in the audience watching this?","startTime":"42:53","endTime":"42:58","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like what if you want to get into this stuff, like what have you found?","startTime":"42:58","endTime":"43:01","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Well, I mean basically what we do is we ingest all the manuals for the machine.","startTime":"43:03","endTime":"43:09","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"43:09","endTime":"43:10","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then we plug it into the PLC system and as you say quite rightly, we then integrate that so that we're taking the signals from the machines and feeding them into our box along with all the data that we're collecting from our sensors.","startTime":"43:10","endTime":"43:27","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then in order to calibrate the machine we have a component that we make and that component, if you like, stresses out the machine.","startTime":"43:29","endTime":"43:41","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We make it do stuff that is really at the edge of the envelope of what it wants to do.","startTime":"43:41","endTime":"43:46","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And that generates noise, vibration, heat and power consumption.","startTime":"43:46","endTime":"43:51","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then we can correlate that.","startTime":"43:51","endTime":"43:53","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So then we take the machine part off and we measure it and then we'll push it and push it until we reach a failure point.","startTime":"43:53","endTime":"44:02","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then we correlate the sound or the vibration or the heat signature to that point in time.","startTime":"44:02","endTime":"44:09","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So then because this curve is sort of usually it's not kind of linear, it kind of pops along and then suddenly it kind of pops off the scale.","startTime":"44:09","endTime":"44:19","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we just need to focus in on that, that inflection point.","startTime":"44:20","endTime":"44:25","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And that's if you like where the AI comes into it, the LLM that is T specific use case.","startTime":"44:26","endTime":"44:32","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And that then enables us to give feedback to the operator saying refer to page blah blah on the operator manual to do this setting or to change this etc.","startTime":"44:33","endTime":"44:43","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Etc.","startTime":"44:43","endTime":"44:43","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So in a nutshell, we're bringing together all the data because if you think back 20, 30 years ago, the Machinist would be using his eyes and ears and touch to say the machine's running fine now.","startTime":"44:44","endTime":"44:59","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then, I don't know, it put his hand on the machine table and you'd feel a vibration.","startTime":"44:59","endTime":"45:04","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You say, oh, need to turn it down a notch now.","startTime":"45:04","endTime":"45:06","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Oh, that feels better.","startTime":"45:06","endTime":"45:07","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You know, a little bit like when you're tuning a car and you want it to just tick over smoothly so you fiddle about with the carburetor until it's doing its thing.","startTime":"45:07","endTime":"45:16","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"45:17","endTime":"45:17","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So if you like, we're giving naive users the eyes and ears of an expert.","startTime":"45:17","endTime":"45:22","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I mean, this is a long leap from where you started with communication.","startTime":"45:24","endTime":"45:28","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"45:28","endTime":"45:28","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I mean, it's an interesting pivot, I would say, in terms of that.","startTime":"45:28","endTime":"45:31","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that's cool.","startTime":"45:32","endTime":"45:33","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's.","startTime":"45:33","endTime":"45:34","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, I mean.","startTime":"45:34","endTime":"45:34","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But I mean, I suppose at the heart of all this is DSP technology, digital signal processing, because that's what we're doing.","startTime":"45:35","endTime":"45:41","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We're processing, we're turning analog information into digital information, which were then, in a way, turning into analog information for human consumption.","startTime":"45:41","endTime":"45:50","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right, that's fair enough.","startTime":"45:50","endTime":"45:52","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's fair enough.","startTime":"45:52","endTime":"45:52","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Enough.","startTime":"45:53","endTime":"45:53","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Very cool.","startTime":"45:54","endTime":"45:54","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that's where you're.","startTime":"45:54","endTime":"45:55","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Is that where the current focus is mostly now, or is there a new.","startTime":"45:55","endTime":"45:58","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's a new iteration of the Astro coming out or how.","startTime":"46:00","endTime":"46:02","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What's the, what's the roadmap looking for?","startTime":"46:02","endTime":"46:04","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think at the moment the Astro is kind of on the shelf, if I like, if you like.","startTime":"46:05","endTime":"46:12","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And our focus is really on the network appliances because we see there it's an easier sell.","startTime":"46:12","endTime":"46:17","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We sell, if you like, to corporates or cloud users and so on.","startTime":"46:17","endTime":"46:22","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And we've got.","startTime":"46:23","endTime":"46:23","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Got a lot of interest in, in Asia, thanks to what we're doing in Singapore and Japan.","startTime":"46:23","endTime":"46:29","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I mean, just looking back at the Astro and the range of phones that we did in the past, Japan was always one of our best markets because really they.","startTime":"46:29","endTime":"46:39","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, because they like being able to type in kanji fast on the keyboard.","startTime":"46:39","endTime":"46:44","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So that's just an aside but interesting from an ergonomics point of view and usability point of view.","startTime":"46:45","endTime":"46:50","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The other thing we're doing is we've also got a project in logistics using a radio technology from a Danish company called Neocortec.","startTime":"46:52","endTime":"47:01","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And this is for tracking assets like the containers and pallets and packages.","startTime":"47:02","endTime":"47:09","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And the use case is driven by Brexit.","startTime":"47:10","endTime":"47:15","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because of Brexit, actually red tape has become even bigger for the UK market than it ever was before.","startTime":"47:15","endTime":"47:21","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So the basic concept that we're trialing at the moment is we have our Neocortec mesh network tags in all the palettes and when the pallets are loaded with the goods and products, they're all scanned and associated with this palette.","startTime":"47:22","endTime":"47:40","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So when this palette moves from, I don't know, Istanbul to London, when it's loaded, that bill of lading is sent to HMRC into the airline, the pallet is loaded into the plane.","startTime":"47:41","endTime":"47:57","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The other cool thing about Neocortec is that if there's no gateway present, all the mobile nodes go silent.","startTime":"47:57","endTime":"48:08","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"They're just in listening mode at this point and they wake up.","startTime":"48:08","endTime":"48:13","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You can set the frequency at which they wake up and that will determine this lifespan of the battery.","startTime":"48:13","endTime":"48:18","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But we've tuned it so the lifespan is about seven years.","startTime":"48:18","endTime":"48:21","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Oh wow.","startTime":"48:22","endTime":"48:22","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And, and so the pilot then arrives in London, it's loaded off the plane and there's a gateway at the airport and the all the little nodes wake up and HMRC then gets notification that this has happened.","startTime":"48:22","endTime":"48:38","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And this initiates digitally all the transactions that are required in order for the goods to be imported into the uk.","startTime":"48:38","endTime":"48:45","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Payment of taxes, documentation, if it's, I don't know, animals or whatever it might be.","startTime":"48:46","endTime":"48:54","speaker_name":"Marcus Taylor","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So that means that effectively as soon as it's taken
