Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That was like, hey, if you're kind of a nerdy open source guy, this is the stuff you would have picked to kind of, you know, think of it as building your home PC but for email.","startTime":"04:09","endTime":"04:17","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then from that we built enterprise extensions around that, around disaster recovery support with the thing of like hey, if you want to do this and want to do this at your own company.","startTime":"04:17","endTime":"04:28","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You're going to want like somebody to call.","startTime":"04:28","endTime":"04:30","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Your boss is going to want somebody to call to sort of justify it.","startTime":"04:30","endTime":"04:33","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so we sold into a lot of like places

move this thing.","startTime":"04:53","endTime":"04:56","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so she ended up.","startTime":"04:56","endTime":"04:57","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We sold it to VMware.","startTime":"04:57","endTime":"04:59","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So kind of sold it again.","startTime":"04:59","endTime":"05:00","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then at that point VMware sold it to another private equity kind of small

journey.","startTime":"05:05","endTime":"05:07","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And went on into.","startTime":"05:07","endTime":"05:09","speaker_name":"Kevin

Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Cynicore.","startTime":"05:24","endTime":"05:25","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So they were basically buying, they bought Zimbra and then they would host it for like tier 2 and tier 3.","startTime":"05:25","endTime":"05:31","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like so if you're like in a random small rural town and you had like somebody, you know, providing phone service or cable service or dial up Internet and you need an email, they would host the email for you because, you know, you didn't want to do that.","startTime":"05:31","endTime":"05:43","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so then they were using Zimmer to do that hosting.","startTime":"05:43","endTime":"05:44","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So they were like a, you know, kind of an early SaaS provider of Zimbra for others.","startTime":"05:44","endTime":"05:49","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Interesting.","startTime":"05:49","endTime":"05:50","speaker_name":"Viktor

Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like how big was Zimbra when you joined?","startTime":"05:54","endTime":"05:56","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like, it's funny.","startTime":"05:56","endTime":"05:57","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I mean, talk about like opportunities missed.","startTime":"05:57","endTime":"06:00","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I remember having coffee with the

months.","startTime":"06:23","endTime":"06:24","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And literally I turned them down.","startTime":"06:24","endTime":"06:26","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so I said, no, I don't want to do it.","startTime":"06:26","endTime":"06:28","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And, and so I stayed at the company Open Wave for another year or so and they kept hitting me, hey man, come over.","startTime":"06:28","endTime":"06:35","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then.","startTime":"06:35","endTime":"06:36","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I think I ended up joining kind of around employee 25 or 30 and crazy stories to talk about

you know, went on to do other successful stuff.","startTime":"07:53","endTime":"07:56","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But it was pretty funny to see the early days of like, yeah, just getting declined after being invited as an early employee because at that point, you know, when you found a company, you start to scale and build an engineering team, you're no longer doing just founder level hiring.","startTime":"07:56","endTime":"08:11","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You're, you know, you want the team to absorb it, you don't want

nature.","startTime":"08:29","endTime":"08:35","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then again, kind of leaned back into engineering and building the team as the startup

Yahoo.","startTime":"08:58","endTime":"09:03","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean, like there's, you know, Cisco is, you know, notorious for acquiring lots of companies.","startTime":"09:03","endTime":"09:08","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Most of them don't, you know, couple of them worked well, WebEx and things of that nature that, you know, became pretty powerful for them.","startTime":"09:08","endTime":"09:13","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I think a lot of them, they bring the team in, they take the technology.","startTime":"09:13","endTime":"09:17","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It doesn't really go the way they want.","startTime":"09:17","endTime":"09:18","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They promise things.","startTime":"09:18","endTime":"09:20","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The promises are broken on both sides.","startTime":"09:20","endTime":"09:22","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I think, you know, Yahoo was no different.","startTime":"09:22","endTime":"09:24","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think, again, something I've learned, you know, as part of like this sort of acquisition of how to like, better.","startTime":"09:24","endTime":"09:31","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think were in, in one way to say it, like a terrible acquisition.","startTime":"09:31","endTime":"09:36","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You know, our bedside manner was bad.","startTime":"09:37","endTime":"09:39","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We kind of came in with this like, hey, were these smart startup guys.","startTime":"09:39","endTime":"09:43","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We've built email.","startTime":"09:43","endTime":"09:43","speaker_name":"Kevin

wrong.","startTime":"09:44","endTime":"09:46","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You need to kind of do it this way.","startTime":"09:46","endTime":"09:48","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that became like this crazy organ rejection where they were like, they hate us.","startTime":"09:48","endTime":"09:52","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And they were like, wait, we bought this thing and we ended up getting Yahoo.","startTime":"09:52","endTime":"09:56","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Calendar migrated to Zimbra Tech, but we never finished the mail migration during the time were there because there was just a lot of organ rejection.","startTime":"09:56","endTime":"10:04","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The Calendar was really bad.","startTime":"10:04","endTime":"10:06","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so that one was.","startTime":"10:06","endTime":"10:07","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it's in.","startTime":"10:07","endTime":"10:08","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Calendar is very hard.","startTime":"10:08","endTime":"10:09","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so.","startTime":"10:09","endTime":"10:09","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And the number of users was much smaller.","startTime":"10:10","endTime":"10:11","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, you know, 10 million people used Calendar where hundreds of millions of people used email.","startTime":"10:11","endTime":"10:16","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"10:16","endTime":"10:17","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But it's forced us to do this kind of like if you've seen the movie 300, where all the gladiators put their shields up and kind of hide.","startTime":"10:17","endTime":"10:23","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right?","startTime":"10:23","endTime":"10:24","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"10:24","endTime":"10:24","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like that's the way we ended up.","startTime":"10:24","endTime":"10:26","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We literally had our own area in the Yahoo office where the Zimbabwe guys would all kind of camp out away from the other male and collaboration team, even though were part of it.","startTime":"10:26","endTime":"10:33","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So were kind of like this, you know, ugly stepchild thing kind of stored in the Corner.","startTime":"10:33","endTime":"10:37","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But we kept our enterprise business.","startTime":"10:39","endTime":"10:41","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We kept doing open source sales, like very.","startTime":"10:41","endTime":"10:43","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"On Yahoo stuff like they're a very consumer company.","startTime":"10:43","endTime":"10:45","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We were doing enterprise sales smelling small businesses.","startTime":"10:45","endTime":"10:48","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And because of that, when it became time for Yahoo to sort of unwind some of these things, they're like, oh, they're shutting things down, killing things, just laying people off.","startTime":"10:48","endTime":"10:57","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They're like, oh, the Zimmer thing's actually worth something.","startTime":"10:57","endTime":"10:59","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's actually doing revenue.","startTime":"10:59","endTime":"11:00","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There's millions in recurring revenue and there's real customers and their sales here.","startTime":"11:00","endTime":"11:03","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so then that's where the VMware acquisition came out.","startTime":"11:03","endTime":"11:06","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And were able to kind of sell the company again into VMware.","startTime":"11:06","endTime":"11:10","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then because VMware was on this, they had been a lot of.","startTime":"11:10","endTime":"11:12","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Palmertz was the CEO and he had hired a lot.","startTime":"11:13","endTime":"11:15","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"He was, you know, the guy that kind of invented the word dog food at Microsoft, like, hey, eat your own dog food, try your own software.","startTime":"11:15","endTime":"11:21","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And he had brought in a lot of like the old guard from Microsoft that were in the early days of Windows and Office.","startTime":"11:21","endTime":"11:26","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And their view was like, man, VMware has this like lockstep sales mechanism or motion that sells into it, obviously selling virtualization.","startTime":"11:26","endTime":"11:36","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Could we also have an app stack that's a little higher, that's something akin to Microsoft Office but built on the cloud.","startTime":"11:36","endTime":"11:41","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"11:41","endTime":"11:41","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so they acquired a bunch of These kind of web2SaaS, early kind of JavaScript driven collaboration tools with the idea of bringing those together and building like a kind of a, an app group.","startTime":"11:41","endTime":"11:55","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And they picked up Bitnami around that era as well.","startTime":"11:56","endTime":"11:59","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's a bit later.","startTime":"11:59","endTime":"11:59","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think it was Bitnami.","startTime":"11:59","endTime":"12:00","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right, they picked up as well.","startTime":"12:00","endTime":"12:01","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right?","startTime":"12:01","endTime":"12:01","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, they picked a bunch of companies.","startTime":"12:01","endTime":"12:02","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so it was cool.","startTime":"12:02","endTime":"12:03","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We got to meet a bunch of really cool founders again.","startTime":"12:03","endTime":"12:05","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Didn't really work like as you can imagine, the buyer of VMware and buying infrastructure software, the data center side, the, you know, the networking side, very different buyer than who bought Microsoft Office, right?","startTime":"12:05","endTime":"12:21","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yes.","startTime":"12:21","endTime":"12:22","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And who bought Exchange.","startTime":"12:22","endTime":"12:23","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so like it just didn't fit.","startTime":"12:23","endTime":"12:25","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it was like this again, really weird thing.","startTime":"12:25","endTime":"12:27","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so as that started to unwind, you know, and they started to sell pieces of that and kind of unload that.","startTime":"12:27","endTime":"12:34","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Similarly, Zimbra was one where a lot of companies, they just shut down what they had bought.","startTime":"12:34","endTime":"12:38","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But Zimbra had this enterprise base of like recurring revenue.","startTime":"12:38","endTime":"12:41","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Somebody would buy it.","startTime":"12:41","endTime":"12:42","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so again it kind of, you know, the price kind of went down, as you can imagine, in each sale.","startTime":"12:42","endTime":"12:46","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"12:46","endTime":"12:47","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Closer to what the revenue Is and less of like the.","startTime":"12:47","endTime":"12:50","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There was less of a premium, if you wouldn't say for like the team and the innovation at that point.","startTime":"12:50","endTime":"12:54","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because it's like man, we're just buying it for what's the revenues there.","startTime":"12:54","endTime":"12:57","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So another kind of company bought it and then eventually like I said, one of the early customers bought it because they were the ones that knew how to like monetize it.","startTime":"12:57","endTime":"13:04","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"13:04","endTime":"13:05","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And.","startTime":"13:05","endTime":"13:05","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And it was basically just support revenue, then support contracts that you're monetizing.","startTime":"13:05","endTime":"13:10","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Support revenue and a little bit of nre.","startTime":"13:10","endTime":"13:11","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So non recurring engineering.","startTime":"13:11","endTime":"13:12","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So like consulting type work around it installation, helping them, you know, go do and do migrations and things of that nature.","startTime":"13:12","endTime":"13:18","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But the core of it was yeah what looked like support revenue but they actually got some code so they would get like an enterprise extension or a blessed build that had like some extra features on it around disaster recovery support for different architectures and things of that nature.","startTime":"13:18","endTime":"13:33","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But it's interesting because that's an interesting insight into how open source revenue generation has evolved over time.","startTime":"13:33","endTime":"13:42","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"13:42","endTime":"13:42","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because that was like if you go back to MySQL kind of from the same era, right?","startTime":"13:42","endTime":"13:48","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"In the sense that when Oracle acquired them that was support contract largely as well that they built their business around money.","startTime":"13:48","endTime":"13:54","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Zimbra was built on MySQL we use my sequel and a lot of the databases underneath.","startTime":"13:55","endTime":"14:00","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We ended up moving to like Berkeley B and a couple other sort of different technologies for scale reasons and other, you know, sort of like alternative architectures.","startTime":"14:00","endTime":"14:07","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because you can imagine like when you get to like carrier level scale with tens of millions, like comcast for example, AT&T kind of like really big scales.","startTime":"14:07","endTime":"14:15","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We did.","startTime":"14:15","endTime":"14:16","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So Xfinity mail ran on Zimbra like that was one of our biggest customers.","startTime":"14:16","endTime":"14:19","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I know because we work with them at Screenly.","startTime":"14:19","endTime":"14:21","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Sorry at Yippee Move.","startTime":"14:21","endTime":"14:23","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Actually were working with Comcast as well, which is funny crossover.","startTime":"14:23","endTime":"14:27","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Good stuff.","startTime":"14:28","endTime":"14:29","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"All right, so the biggest lesson for that acquisition that was really just like you kind of the organ rejection as you call it, right.","startTime":"14:29","endTime":"14:36","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like being kind of like not kind of embracing being absorbed I guess by a larger entity.","startTime":"14:36","endTime":"14:44","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So walking forward then to the next big thing was a company, which is your next big venture, that then subsequently got acquired by Microsoft.","startTime":"14:45","endTime":"14:55","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"How did that experience with VMware and Yahoo kind of shape your worldview as you made your way into the next acquisition and how do you think about that?","startTime":"14:56","endTime":"15:08","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So personally, I mean, completely different approach.","startTime":"15:08","endTime":"15:10","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"15:11","endTime":"15:11","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so I think the approach that we described at Yahoo and to some extent at VMware but not as much like this organ rejection.","startTime":"15:11","endTime":"15:17","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You're like, hey, we're the intelligent jerk that come in there and we're going to, you know, we're going to teach this big company how to be startupy and we're going to have this founder led, sort of like startup led way of going through it.","startTime":"15:17","endTime":"15:29","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It just doesn't work for most of acquisitions.","startTime":"15:29","endTime":"15:32","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And what I advise, like, you know, people that are getting acquired now or early founders or, you know, when you're going through these acquisition is like the day you sign the acquisition, you need to switch your hat from like founder leader, startup person to like advisor.","startTime":"15:32","endTime":"15:46","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And advisor is a key thing because when you're an advisor, you can say all the smart things and give advice and you can guide and coach, but you can't ultimately actually do the thing typically.","startTime":"15:46","endTime":"15:58","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And you're not.","startTime":"15:58","endTime":"15:59","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And you should be okay with that.","startTime":"15:59","endTime":"16:00","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, it's okay that like the person you're advising ignores 10% of what you did or ignores 90%.","startTime":"16:00","endTime":"16:06","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It only takes 10%.","startTime":"16:06","endTime":"16:07","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's up to them.","startTime":"16:07","endTime":"16:08","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so when went into Microsoft, I had this kind of view that, hey, I'm just here to help.","startTime":"16:08","endTime":"16:13","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I'm here to help scale their systems, give them advice.","startTime":"16:13","endTime":"16:16","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I went around and gave like lots of talks to other groups, did a ton of like more evangelist kind of work.","startTime":"16:16","endTime":"16:22","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If you almost go back to my early Zimbra days, right, of like evangelizing like the way that we built software.","startTime":"16:22","endTime":"16:27","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Hey, man, right?","startTime":"16:27","endTime":"16:28","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You know, Microsoft had kind of traditionally always shipped every three years.","startTime":"16:28","endTime":"16:31","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They were like, hey, let's go to every year.","startTime":"16:31","endTime":"16:33","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They were really proud of their monthly release cycle with some of their apps.","startTime":"16:33","endTime":"16:36","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And were like, no, no, we're going to ship every Friday.","startTime":"16:36","endTime":"16:38","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The best way to do mobile is, you know, five star apps shipped every seven days.","startTime":"16:38","endTime":"16:42","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that's the way you iterate in mobile.","startTime":"16:42","endTime":"16:44","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And you know, on Friday we would finish the build, we would test over the weekend, and then we would submit to App Store on Monday, fix any bugs, and then Tuesday we would release and then we'd do it again.","startTime":"16:44","endTime":"16:53","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that model and now today you literally look at it.","startTime":"16:53","endTime":"16:56","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Outlook Mobile still ships like that.","startTime":"16:56","endTime":"16:57","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They ship every week.","startTime":"16:57","endTime":"16:58","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And if you look at that, so does all the Office apps.","startTime":"16:58","endTime":"17:01","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They all have this release channel where they ship every week.","startTime":"17:01","endTime":"17:03","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because in the mobile space it's okay to have those updates.","startTime":"17:03","endTime":"17:07","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They have to be clean, they have to work and you want to just keep taking shots on goal.","startTime":"17:07","endTime":"17:10","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You don't want to have a bunch of unshipped Software that's sitting in like GitHub untested or whatever.","startTime":"17:10","endTime":"17:15","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"17:15","endTime":"17:15","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so for us, like going into Microsoft, the acquisition was, you know, on a bunch of levels, way more successful.","startTime":"17:15","endTime":"17:22","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"17:22","endTime":"17:23","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The app is like, you know, hundreds and hundreds of millions of users use Outlook Mobile today.","startTime":"17:23","endTime":"17:27","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That app is still very much the accompli.","startTime":"17:27","endTime":"17:30","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Vibes are in there.","startTime":"17:30","endTime":"17:31","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There's actually people that are still there from the acquisition, some that have left and come back actually that came to Instacart with us.","startTime":"17:31","endTime":"17:38","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You know, one of the lead developers, Ogden, who's on the, you know, left and came to Instacart and then went back to Microsoft afterwards and taking some time off.","startTime":"17:38","endTime":"17:46","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so like really has like this, you know, much more glamorous story of like what Outlook turned into and how that not only transformed a lot of the stuff that was the way Office worked and the way mobile apps worked, but I think a lot of that stems from like us as the team and the founders thinking a lot differently than the way that what we learned from going into Yahoo or going into VMware.","startTime":"17:46","endTime":"18:11","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then our co founder, so JJ and I were the, you know, two of the founders and then Javier was the third founder.","startTime":"18:11","endTime":"18:15","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"He had actually also sold a company into VMware and like Zimbra, you know, it didn't go well and it was like a tough acquisition and like it didn't have a good fit and well, you know.","startTime":"18:15","endTime":"18:25","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But the his was called Hyperic.","startTime":"18:26","endTime":"18:28","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They sold into Spring Source and then Spring Source got pulled into VMware and there again like they were good, they had traction but didn't reach the like, you know, 10 years later, like we're now Outlook Mobile has been into Outlook, into Microsoft for 10 years, has like this incredibly positive reception.","startTime":"18:28","endTime":"18:42","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"People still love it's still wonderful and all those things.","startTime":"18:42","endTime":"18:44","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so I think that story was much more around us being just a better partner, coming in and thinking of ourselves as advisors and being helpful and there to be, you know, integration first.","startTime":"18:45","endTime":"18:56","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like silly things like the instant you get there, everybody starts using Microsoft email accounts.","startTime":"18:56","endTime":"19:00","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We don't start keeping our like it Yahoo.","startTime":"19:00","endTime":"19:03","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We literally kept our Zimbra email accounts even through the Yahoo transition.","startTime":"19:03","endTime":"19:05","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We kept, oh no, we're Zimbra.","startTime":"19:05","endTime":"19:07","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We're not, you know, we had our own business.","startTime":"19:07","endTime":"19:09","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I literally have business cards still from VMware where you turn them over and they're

goals of that business?","startTime":"20:15","endTime":"20:16","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And get aligned with that and use what you've learned as an infant to

there.","startTime":"20:28","endTime":"20:30","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like, one of the things that we've had a lot of conversations about over the years is like,

almost.","startTime":"20:34","endTime":"20:45","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But by virtue of doing that, you build system because you force cadence and that cadence, in order to deliver that cadence, so many other things need to fall into place.","startTime":"20:45","endTime":"20:57","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I think let's talk more about that because there are so many.","startTime":"20:57","endTime":"21:00","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"There's a lot more importance in that than just, oh, we ship on Friday.","startTime":"21:01","endTime":"21:06","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's a cascading impact.","startTime":"21:06","endTime":"21:08","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Maybe let's unpack that a bit more because I think there's a lot of insights from this.","startTime":"21:08","endTime":"21:12","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Having that steady cadence.","startTime":"21:12","endTime":"21:13","speaker_name":"Viktor

right.","startTime":"21:14","endTime":"21:15","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think the high level thing is easy to say.","startTime":"21:15","endTime":"21:18","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, it's super hard to do and definitely takes a bunch of adjustments.","startTime":"21:18","endTime":"21:24","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right?","startTime":"21:24","endTime":"21:24","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"21:24","endTime":"21:24","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You have to think about, like, what does that mean to ship every week?","startTime":"21:24","endTime":"21:26","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Well, you need to break things down into like two or three day tasks so that you're like those all fit inside of a week.","startTime":"21:26","endTime":"21:33","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so if they don't, you know, you can't have like a two month rewrite.","startTime":"21:33","endTime":"21:36","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You're like, well you can, but you need to break it into three day chunks and ship a couple of those every week and make progress kind of hidden in the way like so that you're not doing this big bang sort of like release.","startTime":"21:36","endTime":"21:46","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The other thing it sort of says is that like, you know, incredibly highly, you know, competent senior engineers, like the lead engineers on the team that know exactly what they're doing, make a small change, they can ship.","startTime":"21:47","endTime":"21:58","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You know, we would cut the builds at like 6pm Pacific, typically at 5:58, they could check in a change, right?","startTime":"21:58","endTime":"22:04","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because they knew like, hey, I'm confident this is the thing, I know all the ramifications and you know, the chance that they're wrong is low.","startTime":"22:04","endTime":"22:11","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Junior developer that had a bunch of new code, similarly, with a small change would be more comfortable checking in on Monday, letting that sit on the dev branch, have a few, you know, a few more days to settle people to look at it, catch ramifications.","startTime":"22:11","endTime":"22:22","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then you would learn like, what's that mean?","startTime":"22:23","endTime":"22:24","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If you would check that stuff in, you're like, oh man, we shouldn't make changes to core data

Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"22:32","endTime":"22:33","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so we'd start to learn those things.","startTime":"22:33","endTime":"22:34","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so those systems kind of backed into that like how we planned in Jira, like how we built our sprints, like how we worked through that, the kind of things when they got into qa.","startTime":"22:34","endTime":"22:44","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so like I said, we would test on Friday, they would test all weekend, kind of 24 by 7 for, you know, or 3, 3 by 7, I guess, you know, or 3 by 24 for those, you know, three days.","startTime":"22:45","endTime":"22:54","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then Monday we would have a report when we get to the office at 6:00am, you know, 9:00am New York and they would start to look through the issues.","startTime":"22:54","endTime":"23:00","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And if there was major things, you would always just pull it out.","startTime":"23:00","endTime":"23:03","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like you wouldn't try to like patch it.","startTime":"23:03","endTime":"23:04","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You would just be like, no, no, there's something wrong here.","startTime":"23:04","endTime":"23:06","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like this change is just getting backed out and removed from the build and let's try again next week.","startTime":"23:06","endTime":"23:11","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so that system of like knowing the entire release, just, no, you wouldn't skip the release.","startTime":"23:11","endTime":"23:15","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You would pull those.","startTime":"23:15","endTime":"23:16","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, you would not release with that change.","startTime":"23:18","endTime":"23:20","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And if it was a small change, you'd like, oh, there was a small Thing with a, like sometimes you'd catch like a label or a translation issue.","startTime":"23:20","endTime":"23:26","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But again, we shipped Outlook, I mean when we did a complete, we probably shipped in like 15 languages.","startTime":"23:26","endTime":"23:31","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"With Outlook we shipped in like almost 90 or something crazy.","startTime":"23:31","endTime":"23:34","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like you can go look in the App Store.","startTime":"23:34","endTime":"23:35","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's a huge number.","startTime":"23:35","endTime":"23:36","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And those translations.","startTime":"23:36","endTime":"23:38","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So the string changes had to be in by Wednesday so you could get the translations by Thursday so you could check them on Friday.","startTime":"23:38","endTime":"23:42","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So they would make the build, right.","startTime":"23:42","endTime":"23:44","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so all those systems skating know that if you're going to make a string change and so developers would do this, right?","startTime":"23:44","endTime":"23:49","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Hey, I'm working on a new chunk of tech.","startTime":"23:49","endTime":"23:52","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Oh, but there's going to be strings.","startTime":"23:52","endTime":"23:54","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So even on Monday or Tuesday they would have to define the strings that they're going to use so that those could be in even though their code may not land until Thursday or Friday.","startTime":"23:54","endTime":"24:03","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right?","startTime":"24:03","endTime":"24:03","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And there, yeah, a lot of little things that sort of come together when you have that.","startTime":"24:03","endTime":"24:09","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The craziest one was Microsoft.","startTime":"24:09","endTime":"24:11","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"When we got there, it took them seven days to build and sign a release.","startTime":"24:11","endTime":"24:15","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Oh shit.","startTime":"24:15","endTime":"24:16","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"They had a team that was like the Apple build signing team.","startTime":"24:16","endTime":"24:19","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And we're like, okay, wait a minute.","startTime":"24:19","endTime":"24:21","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like the way we used to do it is like you'd check it out, the iOS developer would click Sign and it was like 17 seconds on their, you know, MacBook Pro to sign the build and they had the keys and Microsoft had like a lot of structure where it was like, no, it was signed on certain servers.","startTime":"24:21","endTime":"24:34","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Those servers were in Puerto Rico.","startTime":"24:34","endTime":"24:35","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There was like a lot of like, you know, restrictions around how we had to build it and it had to be, you know, as you can imagine, it's Microsoft.","startTime":"24:35","endTime":"24:41","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it's very tricky.","startTime":"24:41","endTime":"24:43","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I'm like at the end of the day somebody's clicking sign on that build and it's taking 17 seconds.","startTime":"24:43","endTime":"24:49","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It was just like you had to submit this form and give it to this team.","startTime":"24:49","endTime":"24:52","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I was like, we need to go back to 17 seconds.","startTime":"24:52","endTime":"24:54","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so we did, we worked with that team.","startTime":"24:54","endTime":"24:56","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It took a bit of pulling, a little bit of carrot, a lot of stick to say, no, we're going to do this and keep our seven day release process up because we can't have a seven days to sign the build if we're going to ship every Friday.","startTime":"24:56","endTime":"25:08","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And what was cool is that we did make those changes and then that team ended up not having build signing anymore because now it's like you would just go to sign the build and we automated it by building a system where it's like, when we're done, each of the individual dev teams on those apps could say, sign the build.","startTime":"25:09","endTime":"25:24","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it would just get done in, you know, less than a minute.","startTime":"25:24","endTime":"25:26","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Where the old days, it was this whole, like, manual process of people.","startTime":"25:26","endTime":"25:29","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I think a lot of that maps today's world of AI, that if you do put automation and AI in the case, that one individual can have much more power, but you have to trust and put the systems in place so that one individual can't make a bunch of mistakes.","startTime":"25:30","endTime":"25:43","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"25:44","endTime":"25:44","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because now that you're saying, hey, there's no longer a gatekeeper for signing mobile builds, you're like, well, 25 people can now sign mobile builds because they're all like, on these individual app teams, how do you put the right systems in place to make sure that's correct?","startTime":"25:44","endTime":"25:58","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And how do you build that in code so that even if a new person comes in or if they, you know, make a mistake, it catches the mistake automatically versus that mistake going out?","startTime":"25:58","endTime":"26:06","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because now it's a automated system.","startTime":"26:06","endTime":"26:08","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But with those, like that signing process, I presume that was done in a CI CD pipeline, not like literally on somebody's desktop, right?","startTime":"26:08","endTime":"26:16","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"26:16","endTime":"26:17","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So at Microsoft it was, right, it was done in a CI, but it was not a fully automated CI cd.","startTime":"26:17","endTime":"26:20","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, so that was the thing.","startTime":"26:20","endTime":"26:22","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It was.","startTime":"26:22","endTime":"26:22","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It was like, oh, you had to file a request and they would go into the form because if you can remember, the way to sign an Apple build was still, it wasn't like you couldn't.","startTime":"26:22","endTime":"26:30","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There wasn't like build bots and things like that.","startTime":"26:30","endTime":"26:32","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, you had to go into the Apple Portal and do stuff and pull down the certificates.","startTime":"26:32","endTime":"26:36","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There was a lot of manual things that had to happen.","startTime":"26:36","endTime":"26:38","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so you would literally sign them on a laptop, you know, in the of like, pull it down and signed it.","startTime":"26:39","endTime":"26:45","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But we automated all and scripted it.","startTime":"26:45","endTime":"26:47","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And some of that was tricky to script.","startTime":"26:47","endTime":"26:48","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Now, of course, that seems silly because you can just go to GitHub Actions or something simple and there's a hundred different ways to like fully automate it, the full process.","startTime":"26:48","endTime":"26:56","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so.","startTime":"26:57","endTime":"26:57","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I think that still holds true today, where you're like, well, I have to send this Gmail thing, or I want to make this post, or I want to do this thing where it requires a human or edit this podcast.","startTime":"26:58","endTime":"27:09","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Well, how do you do that?","startTime":"27:09","endTime":"27:10","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Well, there's no script to go edit podcast.","startTime":"27:10","endTime":"27:12","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's all tools and things on your desktop.","startTime":"27:12","endTime":"27:15","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But if you wanted to fully automate it with AI building the AI agent, it would have to have some sort of human, like sort of interface or web browser sort of app level interface to make that work.","startTime":"27:15","endTime":"27:25","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so I think there's a lot of parallels today to the systems that trying to make something fully automatic from a system point of view needs you to think a little differently.","startTime":"27:26","endTime":"27:36","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right?","startTime":"27:36","endTime":"27:36","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because you can't just like, use the tools the way you're using it if you're sitting at the computer with a keyboard and a mouse and looking at the screen.","startTime":"27:36","endTime":"27:42","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"No, I think there are so much system thinking that goes into this.","startTime":"27:42","endTime":"27:46","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right?","startTime":"27:46","endTime":"27:46","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like doing it properly.","startTime":"27:46","endTime":"27:47","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like, you just.","startTime":"27:47","endTime":"27:48","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I mean, there are companies out there that still not using like CI cd.","startTime":"27:48","endTime":"27:51","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like I've had people on the podcast, like, particularly in the IoT space, like people, like, they're still building like firmware on somebody's like dusty computer under their desk and like, oh, yeah, that I'm not sure you saw.","startTime":"27:51","endTime":"28:01","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like, I just read before we hopped on like Sam, I think it was Samsung, one of the sound bars was not Sonos One, but somebody.","startTime":"28:01","endTime":"28:07","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"They've shipped the faulty update and like brick the entire fleet of devices.","startTime":"28:07","endTime":"28:10","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And it's just like, how is this happening?","startTime":"28:11","endTime":"28:13","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right?","startTime":"28:13","endTime":"28:14","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So like these processes and like having those safeguards, which is why having that cadence of like, no, we ship every Friday really forces you to have trust in the system.","startTime":"28:15","endTime":"28:25","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I think that is the biggest, at least for me, that's the biggest takeaway of that.","startTime":"28:25","endTime":"28:28","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right?","startTime":"28:29","endTime":"28:29","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"28:29","endTime":"28:30","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And also that the system itself should be code.","startTime":"28:30","endTime":"28:33","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right?","startTime":"28:33","endTime":"28:34","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's this whole notion of like, terraform and like, you know, infrastructure as a service.","startTime":"28:34","endTime":"28:37","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And how do you define your AWS environment?","startTime":"28:37","endTime":"28:39","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, that should not be like, oh, it's just set up because we set it up the way we did.","startTime":"28:39","endTime":"28:43","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's like, no, there's code that you can go to a blank AWS account and generate your entire setup in your environment.","startTime":"28:43","endTime":"28:50","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And again, that's hard.","startTime":"28:50","endTime":"28:51","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's easier now with more tools, but you have to put the work in to do that.","startTime":"28:52","endTime":"28:56","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Where it's probably easier to just spin up an EC2 thing or a lambda instance and just upload your code just in the UI because it's faster.","startTime":"28:56","endTime":"29:02","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But if you let that baggage pile up and you haven't like, clean slate, fully automated, someday something's going to fail or you need to recreate that environment and then you don't have it in code because it's not been defined.","startTime":"29:02","endTime":"29:13","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so I think, to me, I always look at all these systems and processes of like, well, if you Replace the human.","startTime":"29:13","endTime":"29:19","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If you replace the computer, could you still run it completely end

right?","startTime":"32:12","endTime":"32:14","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So like at Microsoft, like, it's not just like they don't use like the database that's built

it's crazy level that they go to it.","startTime":"32:25","endTime":"32:27","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But that database now runs inside of Outlook Mobile ON Android

put together.","startTime":"32:32","endTime":"32:35","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So as these teams started to scale, some was through organic growth where it was just like, hey, Kevin, can you reorg?","startTime":"32:35","endTime":"32:41","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We're going to move the Mac team into your

college.","startTime":"33:34","endTime":"33:36","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then you're like, okay, well now I need a manager.","startTime":"33:36","endTime":"33:38","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And you don't want the manager to be fresh out of college, so you start interviewing.","startTime":"33:39","endTime":"33:41","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So like the hiring, the key hire was like hiring the manager for the team in suo.","startTime":"33:41","endTime":"33:46","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I spent all my effort on that, hiring that leader.","startTime":"33:46","endTime":"33:48","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then from that leader, we added the other five to kind of get to the full 10 team.","startTime":"33:48","endTime":"33:53","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then I would make trips over there to go visit.","startTime":"33:53","endTime":"33:56","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that team, you know, was like, really successful and working really good.","startTime":"33:56","endTime":"33:59","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we're like, great, let's scale it to 20.","startTime":"33:59","endTime":"34:00","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so you just, you know, the next class comes in and you get two more groups of five.","startTime":"34:00","endTime":"34:03","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And you know, and then similar, like Microsoft's like, well, we don't hire in Pune, but we have a team in Bangalore, Hyderabad.","startTime":"34:04","endTime":"34:11","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Let's go add 10 people there.","startTime":"34:11","endTime":"34:12","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so we started a team there, you know, and so you, and then you're like, what do you want them to work on?","startTime":"34:12","endTime":"34:16","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And you're like, okay, well, there's this big project and you're going to assign a big chunk of that.","startTime":"34:16","endTime":"34:20","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then, you know, same thing with

them and pair them up.","startTime":"34:26","endTime":"34:32","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so the scale that Microsoft does things and a big company does things is very different than the way that you hire at startups.","startTime":"34:33","endTime":"34:38","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so you get kind of.","startTime":"34:38","endTime":"34:39","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Or they're like, hey, we're doing this REORG and there's 15 people that we don't have like

right?","startTime":"34:59","endTime":"35:03","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, they've passed this bar.","startTime":"35:03","endTime":"35:04","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And you see this at Google, Facebook.","startTime":"35:04","endTime":"35:05","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"A lot of these companies are like, they can.","startTime":"35:05","endTime":"35:07","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They can learn very

solving are not technical at all.","startTime":"38:03","endTime":"38:07","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They're very much like logistical and humans and cultural.","startTime":"38:07","endTime":"38:11","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Or you'd be, you know, a lot of stuff in big companies around promo, leveling, titling, you know, hey, how do I get to the next level?","startTime":"38:12","endTime":"38:18","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so I became really, you know, you understand what the rubric is, but how do you coach people to understand?","startTime":"38:18","endTime":"38:22","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, well, what are you good at?","startTime":"38:22","endTime":"38:23","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Why are you not progressing?","startTime":"38:23","endTime":"38:24","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Are you not collaborating enough?","startTime":"38:24","endTime":"38:26","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Are you not working on hard enough projects?","startTime":"38:26","endTime":"38:28","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because some people would be like, well, I want to be a senior or principal or whatever.","startTime":"38:28","endTime":"38:32","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And they're like, all they're doing is doing really like simple tasks.","startTime":"38:32","endTime":"38:36","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They're not working on team stuff, they're not project leading anything.","startTime":"38:36","endTime":"38:39","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They're, you know, they're only fixing bugs in their area.","startTime":"38:40","endTime":"38:42","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They're not helping other teams.","startTime":"38:42","endTime":"38:43","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like there's just all these kind of like attributes of making a great engineer at a big company that they were missing.","startTime":"38:44","endTime":"38:48","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so you'd have to kind of help them identify that, help them build a plan to work on it and then just kind of coach them.","startTime":"38:48","endTime":"38:54","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"38:54","endTime":"38:54","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then sometimes it would just be speeches, like I would just go to other teams and talk about how we're doing things and tell stories like I'm telling now about accompli and stuff like that.","startTime":"38:54","endTime":"39:02","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so all that sort of leaned into like, you know, running a big team at Microsoft was just very different than, you know, a startup.","startTime":"39:02","endTime":"39:09","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But you also, I mean, it's almost like you're running a remote company because you don't have like 50 people in the same building or 100 people in the same building like that.","startTime":"39:10","endTime":"39:21","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Or you do, but you have it like five times, right?","startTime":"39:21","endTime":"39:22","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You have 100 people five times, right?","startTime":"39:22","endTime":"39:24","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, right.","startTime":"39:24","endTime":"39:25","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But it's like you almost have the same problems as you do with remote, which, like silo, like almost like problems of silos.","startTime":"39:25","endTime":"39:30","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"39:30","endTime":"39:31","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"How do you like.","startTime":"39:31","endTime":"39:32","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And it must be almost more difficult in an environment like that because you don't have like a documentation first culture like you would have in remote work.","startTime":"39:32","endTime":"39:39","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like.","startTime":"39:39","endTime":"39:40","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like there is no that.","startTime":"39:40","endTime":"39:41","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You don't have that shared knowledge base.","startTime":"39:41","endTime":"39:43","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"39:43","endTime":"39:43","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like, what is the experience with that?","startTime":"39:44","endTime":"39:46","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like, how did you solve, like, more than just obviously, oh, let's fly Kevin around the world three times a year.","startTime":"39:46","endTime":"39:51","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like, how do you solve like the silo and like the gaps around that?","startTime":"39:51","endTime":"39:55","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right, yeah.","startTime":"39:55","endTime":"39:55","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So a lot of its systems and so I think one was kind of Org design.","startTime":"39:56","endTime":"40:00","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so you didn't want like, you know, two engineers in India working with two engineers in Suzhou in China and then two engineers in Seattle and one engineer in San Francisco, like on a as like the project team.","startTime":"40:00","endTime":"40:13","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, you know, because it's just tough to collaborate, right?","startTime":"40:13","endTime":"40:16","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Where you.","startTime":"40:16","endTime":"40:17","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you would try to assign like big chunks of projects to given offices.","startTime":"40:17","endTime":"40:21","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Hey, we're going to go do, you know, a bunch of things around?","startTime":"40:21","endTime":"40:24","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Or like you would have module ownership.","startTime":"40:24","endTime":"40:26","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like the Calendar was owned by the team in New York.","startTime":"40:26","endTime":"40:28","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"40:29","endTime":"40:29","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so they would work on Calendar.","startTime":"40:29","endTime":"40:30","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So all the people working on calendar on iOS, Android, you know, and Mac could be in New York as a simple example.","startTime":"40:30","endTime":"40:36","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Or all of the, like, bug fixes from Support would come through Sujo.","startTime":"40:36","endTime":"40:42","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that way the support team only had to interview interface with the support team.","startTime":"40:42","endTime":"40:46","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you would solve some things with Org design and sort of project assignment.","startTime":"40:46","endTime":"40:49","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then some of it was Trying to integrate the same systems.","startTime":"40:50","endTime":"40:52","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so it's like, hey, each of these teams had different sprints.","startTime":"40:52","endTime":"40:55","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We were all shipping weekly, but we all should be using the same tools and making sure we're thinking about it the same way and using the same tools.","startTime":"40:55","endTime":"41:01","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You're, again, you're unifying it through the process of people working this in the same way.","startTime":"41:01","endTime":"41:06","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that created this culture of like unity.","startTime":"41:07","endTime":"41:10","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then you would travel, right?","startTime":"41:10","endTime":"41:11","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That was a big thing.","startTime":"41:11","endTime":"41:12","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You would have people from the China office visit India visit us and all, you know, you would pick a couple people, like not just me going there, but it would have the reverse happen where two or three people from a core team and we'd try to align these around big design sprints, big roadmapping sprints, other events at the company to kind of make that connection, to make those sort of interfaces a little more human.","startTime":"41:12","endTime":"41:34","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And to your right, this was pre Covid, right.","startTime":"41:34","endTime":"41:36","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So weren't, we didn't have like, we obviously had video conferencing and all that kind of stuff.","startTime":"41:36","endTime":"41:40","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And we would do that because these offices were remote.","startTime":"41:40","endTime":"41:42","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But it wasn't like now where it's like, you know, almost default every, you know, meeting has a video conference or somebody's not in the office like in most companies.","startTime":"41:43","endTime":"41:51","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so I think that was a big thing.","startTime":"41:51","endTime":"41:52","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But it was sort of a mix of like project assignment, good strong systems and unification of how things worked.","startTime":"41:52","endTime":"41:57","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But then also understanding that there's got to be some cross pollination between the teams to sort of like work on stuff together.","startTime":"41:57","endTime":"42:03","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So a lot of time I would imagine you spent on like writing sops essentially.","startTime":"42:04","endTime":"42:08","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like, how do we do things?","startTime":"42:08","endTime":"42:09","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right?","startTime":"42:09","endTime":"42:10","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, I mean, you.","startTime":"42:10","endTime":"42:11","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I spent a lot of time doing PowerPoints and I tried to stay away from it.","startTime":"42:11","endTime":"42:13","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I tried to do.","startTime":"42:13","endTime":"42:13","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I'm way more of a verbal communicator than a, you know, build a amazing PowerPoint to talk through.","startTime":"42:13","endTime":"42:20","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You know, how I thought about it.","startTime":"42:20","endTime":"42:21","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But a lot of times, you know, I remember you'd get to these offices and you just.","startTime":"42:21","endTime":"42:25","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"My calendar with my admin would have me stacked with one ones.","startTime":"42:25","endTime":"42:28","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I'd be doing like 20 minute one ones with like the team, the leaders.","startTime":"42:28","endTime":"42:31","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I would try to do it like an order where you'd meet with the leaders, understand what they're hearing, then meet with a bunch of the sort of team and then you'd follow up and have dinner or meet with the leaders again at the evening or the next morning to recap what you heard.","startTime":"42:31","endTime":"42:43","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And hey, how can we Work on this.","startTime":"42:43","endTime":"42:44","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Are these themes that we're seeing, Is this what you're seeing?","startTime":"42:44","endTime":"42:47","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Kind of a skip level type of implementation?","startTime":"42:47","endTime":"42:49","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But yeah, it was when you're running teams that are in the hundreds, it's way more of a human resources HR type of job than it is like solving technology problems.","startTime":"42:50","endTime":"43:00","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like you do get into some things, but most of it when you're running large teams like that are very much human resource, sort of like culture, direction, vision.","startTime":"43:00","endTime":"43:11","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I think, you know, it also allows the technical leaders to sort of like, you know, kind of have their own sort of direction or drive without having, you know, sort of the managers tell them what to write or something like that.","startTime":"43:13","endTime":"43:26","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, no, I hear you.","startTime":"43:26","endTime":"43:28","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I have more about that.","startTime":"43:28","endTime":"43:29","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But I want to jump into one thing that you mentioned that I am curious about, which is you mentioned that Microsoft brought their own database for searching emails.","startTime":"43:29","endTime":"43:38","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Why is, because this is something I've read to myself a lot on.","startTime":"43:38","endTime":"43:42","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Why is email search so fundamentally broken in every system?","startTime":"43:42","endTime":"43:47","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like you can never find emails, like maybe Gmail is all right these days, but like for the last 20 years, like email search has been so fundamentally broken.","startTime":"43:47","endTime":"43:56","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Why is that?","startTime":"43:56","endTime":"43:57","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, it's a good question.","startTime":"43:58","endTime":"43:59","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And to be clear, like the databases that they wrote were designed to reduce iops and so actual number of writes to disk.","startTime":"43:59","endTime":"44:06","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so it was a structure of how it was core.","startTime":"44:07","endTime":"44:09","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And here's the problem, right, Is the way that email was designed and the way it was used and the volume of email is very different today than it was back then, right?","startTime":"44:09","endTime":"44:16","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"44:17","endTime":"44:17","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so if you think of the early days of Outlook and anybody who used Outlook 10, 15 years ago was it was all about folders.","startTime":"44:17","endTime":"44:23","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so you would create a bunch of folders and you would drag stuff into folders and that was your sorting mechanism.","startTime":"44:23","endTime":"44:27","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Gmail came up with this idea that there's no folders, it's just labels and folders or this virtual overlay.","startTime":"44:27","endTime":"44:31","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so two different like approaches to email.","startTime":"44:31","endTime":"44:35","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so that's one is like how do people organize and sort of like tag their email?","startTime":"44:36","endTime":"44:40","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Whether it's physically moving them into folders or virtually tagging them.","startTime":"44:40","endTime":"44:43","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then, but the next thing is like there's search and when you're searching it's like there's different intents for that search.","startTime":"44:43","endTime":"44:50","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Are you looking for a keyword, are you looking for a person's name?","startTime":"44:50","endTime":"44:53","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Are you looking for some combination and then what date, relevance, right.","startTime":"44:53","endTime":"44:56","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so there's these kind of like, is it, you know, you're Looking for an email seven years ago.","startTime":"44:56","endTime":"45:00","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I always had this test that Gmail is different in quotes is the first email you get when you start a Gmail account.","startTime":"45:00","endTime":"45:08","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You know, and so I would always test when I would, you know, sign up to a new email service.","startTime":"45:08","endTime":"45:11","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's like, oh, we built this great email client for Gmail.","startTime":"45:11","endTime":"45:14","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So the first thing I would do is search for Gmail is different in quotes.","startTime":"45:14","endTime":"45:17","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And can it actually find the original email from my email box?","startTime":"45:17","endTime":"45:20","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's now 20 years old.","startTime":"45:20","endTime":"45:22","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And almost all of them fail that test in the early days.","startTime":"45:22","endTime":"45:24","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right, right.","startTime":"45:24","endTime":"45:25","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Accompli didn't because we used a combination of device search and server search to make that possible.","startTime":"45:25","endTime":"45:30","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"45:30","endTime":"45:31","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So there's some technical jargon in there, but to answer your specific question, and it was funny, it was the one thing that Bill Gates on me on is that when you do autocomplete and I type in like Victor, if I type in the letter V, what should show up, right?","startTime":"45:31","endTime":"45:45","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Should it be like Victor?","startTime":"45:45","endTime":"45:46","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Should it be like Victoria?","startTime":"45:47","endTime":"45:48","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so there's this notion of the ex girlfriend or kind of like your last, you know, sort of, you know, old partner type of problem where if you've been.","startTime":"45:48","endTime":"45:59","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And maybe the girlfriend's not a good one because you don't email your girlfriend.","startTime":"45:59","endTime":"46:01","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Maybe I did because I was an email.","startTime":"46:01","endTime":"46:02","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But.","startTime":"46:02","endTime":"46:03","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But if you think of the idea of like business partner and you're emailing the same person day after day, they're very recent and they're very highly, you know, sort of like relevant in your, you know, every time you type J, it's my partner JJ Right?","startTime":"46:04","endTime":"46:18","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But let's say I need, I get a new business partner, I start working with a new company.","startTime":"46:18","endTime":"46:21","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's a guy named Jason.","startTime":"46:21","endTime":"46:22","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, when does Jason show up above jj?","startTime":"46:22","endTime":"46:25","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so it's this notion like frequency and recency, right?","startTime":"46:25","endTime":"46:29","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Came up with this thing where we just built an algorithm that said how many times have you emailed that person?","startTime":"46:29","endTime":"46:34","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"How many times have you replied to their email and how many times have you viewed their email over the last like three months?","startTime":"46:34","endTime":"46:39","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then you give more credit to the thing in the last month.","startTime":"46:39","endTime":"46:42","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And when we demoed it to Bill Gates and I, you know, told him like, this is how we build it.","startTime":"46:42","endTime":"46:47","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"He's like, that's the stupidest fucking thing.","startTime":"46:47","endTime":"46:49","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that's his famous quote of like, that's not the right way to do it.","startTime":"46:49","endTime":"46:54","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I was like, well bro, like when you type Javier, which is my co founder or jj, those two came up first Right.","startTime":"46:54","endTime":"47:02","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I was like, you do this in Outlook and you get the First J like J1 Automotive or some shitty contact that you forgot about, right?","startTime":"47:02","endTime":"47:10","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I was like bro, but it works, right?","startTime":"47:10","endTime":"47:13","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And he was just kind of annoyed that it was like not like the computer science perfect answer to like why that way it wasn't doing ranking, it was literally like a rules based system of frequency.","startTime":"47:13","endTime":"47:24","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it was just funny because I was like my first kind of like, you know, it was like a product review I guess were demoing it.","startTime":"47:24","endTime":"47:30","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it was like a product, it was something that existed.","startTime":"47:30","endTime":"47:32","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I'm like, yeah, we should switch Outlook.","startTime":"47:32","endTime":"47:33","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And of course if you look at Outlook today, it uses a version of that, probably smarter but you know, some version of that to fix it.","startTime":"47:33","endTime":"47:39","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so yeah, so I think the answer with search is this combination of like a, it's hard but it's also hard to know what people mean.","startTime":"47:39","endTime":"47:45","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And people search for different things.","startTime":"47:45","endTime":"47:46","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And you watch people use email, they use it very differently.","startTime":"47:46","endTime":"47:49","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Some people look search for, you know, subjects, some people search for content, some people search inside of attachments which is also like, then you have to index them.","startTime":"47:49","endTime":"47:57","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so it's a lot of data.","startTime":"47:57","endTime":"47:58","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so the old days computers and phones for sure didn't have the capability to do that locally.","startTime":"47:59","endTime":"48:04","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so server search became the big thing.","startTime":"48:04","endTime":"48:06","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then it's like, well servers are slow.","startTime":"48:06","endTime":"48:08","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So if I'm on my phone and I have a crappy connection, you know, you're not, you're going to do some device search and then you have to like at what point do you switch to server search?","startTime":"48:08","endTime":"48:16","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so again probably overly nerding out, but this is the nerding out with Victor.","startTime":"48:16","endTime":"48:20","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so yeah, the answer is it depends.","startTime":"48:20","endTime":"48:22","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But yeah, because even today I think like Apple Mail is still like shit when it comes to search.","startTime":"48:22","endTime":"48:28","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like so Apple Mail only uses device search, right?","startTime":"48:29","endTime":"48:31","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They don't use client, they don't have a server, right, because they're just a client.","startTime":"48:31","endTime":"48:34","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So the Apple Mail search will always be somewhat, you know, restricted because they're doing it locally on the client where both Gmail and now Outlook do it with the server.","startTime":"48:35","endTime":"48:44","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So they have like, you know, much more computing power.","startTime":"48:44","endTime":"48:47","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They have a full like text index of all your mail and a bunch of intelligence of how you've used it and so that the quality of it's a little better.","startTime":"48:47","endTime":"48:54","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I will tell you one thing with email which is interesting.","startTime":"48:55","endTime":"48:57","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"People always ask me like what email client, why do you use this?","startTime":"48:58","endTime":"49:00","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And the Best email client typically is the one that comes with the email that you're using.","startTime":"49:00","endTime":"49:05","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So if you're using aol, the best client for AOL is the AOL email client if you're using.","startTime":"49:06","endTime":"49:10","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But okay, the best client for Exchange is Outlook because everything else is going to by definition have bugs.","startTime":"49:11","endTime":"49:18","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Everything else is going to have some developer that's not the same developer that owns the client in the server.","startTime":"49:18","endTime":"49:24","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so yeah, typically you're going to run into issues even if you don't see them ahead of time.","startTime":"49:25","endTime":"49:30","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Oh, when were doing Yippee Move, we saw, I mean the RFC for imap.","startTime":"49:30","endTime":"49:35","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It.","startTime":"49:35","endTime":"49:35","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's an rfc, it's there the people who actually abide by it.","startTime":"49:35","endTime":"49:40","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Not that many.","startTime":"49:40","endTime":"49:41","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, a lot of loose.","startTime":"49:42","endTime":"49:43","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, the nice thing that, you know, Yippee Move had to handle a lot.","startTime":"49:43","endTime":"49:46","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think these days you really, if you're building an email client, you really only have to do Gmail and Office or you know, Microsoft Exchange or Office365.","startTime":"49:46","endTime":"49:54","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And back when we did it with Accompli, Gmail was pretty easy.","startTime":"49:54","endTime":"49:58","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"A lot of people had built for Gmail because it was like very modern APIs and very server driven and they had, you know, built a web client so they didn't have a native client where Outlook.","startTime":"49:58","endTime":"50:06","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"A lot of the logic lived in Outlook, the fat, you know, PC client.","startTime":"50:06","endTime":"50:09","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It was a desktop client and Exchange did not have servers and they had very different versions of it installed on prem.","startTime":"50:10","endTime":"50:15","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Today almost everybody uses cloud email and because of the accompli acquisition, the mail APIs got a lot richer.","startTime":"50:15","endTime":"50:22","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so now like to build, you know, you can thank Accompli for bringing in great APIs into the Office 365 exchange.","startTime":"50:22","endTime":"50:29","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so now people building email and calendaring apps can pretty much build them for Microsoft and for Google without a lot of work.","startTime":"50:29","endTime":"50:36","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And most people just don't use other stuff.","startTime":"50:36","endTime":"50:39","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, crazy side story about email, the very first prototype of EBU was actually a wraparound mutt, the email client where we literally like use PXPEC to like copy things between email boxes over imap.","startTime":"50:39","endTime":"50:52","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Wild drag and drop.","startTime":"50:52","endTime":"50:54","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You're like, yeah, you connect to, yeah, connect to IMAP accounts and basically, you know, shift.","startTime":"50:54","endTime":"50:58","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That was basically it.","startTime":"50:59","endTime":"50:59","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, that was basically it.","startTime":"50:59","endTime":"51:01","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So it worked like talk about approved concept and blast for the past.","startTime":"51:01","endTime":"51:04","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I like it, I like it.","startTime":"51:04","endTime":"51:06","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"All right, so we want to move forward now towards Instacart because that was, I mean that's.","startTime":"51:06","endTime":"51:14","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I mean I hate to use the word but like blitzscaling right.","startTime":"51:14","endTime":"51:17","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"In terms of, like, building a team.","startTime":"51:17","endTime":"51:18","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like, you came in pre Covid, which I guess, obviously without knowing that Covid was about to hit.","startTime":"51:18","endTime":"51:27","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I mean, how A, did you identify that opportunity and B, like, once you actually got on board, like, how the hell do you scale the company without, like, killing it in the process?","startTime":"51:28","endTime":"51:40","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"To the size that had to scale.","startTime":"51:40","endTime":"51:42","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, there was kind of two things there, I think.","startTime":"51:42","endTime":"51:44","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So how do we find it?","startTime":"51:44","endTime":"51:45","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And were working on.","startTime":"51:45","endTime":"51:46","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I left Microsoft kind of thinking about the new thing, working on something new, and got connected through a few friends and into a Porva, the CEO and ended up saying, like.","startTime":"51:46","endTime":"51:56","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, I don't like to meet recruiters, but I'm happy to meet with the CEO.","startTime":"51:56","endTime":"51:59","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You know, kind of this, like, slightly cocky approach to it.","startTime":"51:59","endTime":"52:02","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But they finally said, yeah, Porville meet with you.","startTime":"52:03","endTime":"52:05","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I was like, oh, well, crap.","startTime":"52:05","endTime":"52:06","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, I've used Instacart, like, for seven years they've come to my house and delivered groceries, and I've always been enamored with the other side.","startTime":"52:06","endTime":"52:13","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I'm like, I'm going to sign up for a shopper.","startTime":"52:13","endTime":"52:14","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I signed up to be a shopper.","startTime":"52:14","endTime":"52:16","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And for the next seven days, on two different accounts, I just shopped every day, learning the app and trying it and delivering to all these people all over Silicon Valley.","startTime":"52:16","endTime":"52:24","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so I knew a lot about it.","startTime":"52:24","endTime":"52:25","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we got in the office, he's like, oh, tell me about Outlook.","startTime":"52:25","endTime":"52:27","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You'd worked on mobile, and they were struggling with some of the mobile stuff at the time.","startTime":"52:27","endTime":"52:30","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I was like, man, let's talk about the Shopper app.","startTime":"52:31","endTime":"52:33","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And the Shopper app was actually a test flight, kind of like an enterprise app.","startTime":"52:33","endTime":"52:36","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it didn't come through test flight, but it came through the enterprise build, which was not like a consumer app.","startTime":"52:36","endTime":"52:40","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so there's a bunch of, like, challenges getting it and setting it up.","startTime":"52:40","endTime":"52:43","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so that conversation led to, you know, us joining Instacart and initially was asked to work on fulfillment and kind of Shopper and the Shopper app and things like that, and started with that.","startTime":"52:44","endTime":"52:56","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And, you know, hiring initially was tough.","startTime":"52:56","endTime":"52:59","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It was because, like, I had a network and so were able to bring people from the network.","startTime":"52:59","endTime":"53:03","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think that helped.","startTime":"53:03","endTime":"53:04","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then once you kind of go through your first level of connections and like, the people that were great, you start, you know, doing the classic recruiter and LinkedIn and, you know, selling people on why they want to join.","startTime":"53:04","endTime":"53:13","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The world changed when Covid hit, right?","startTime":"53:14","endTime":"53:16","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because I think two things happened.","startTime":"53:16","endTime":"53:17","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think, one, the world froze for A minute.","startTime":"53:17","endTime":"53:21","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But Instacart's demand went to unlimited.","startTime":"53:21","endTime":"53:23","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, literally unlimited.","startTime":"53:23","endTime":"53:25","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like we just you everybody want was afraid to leave their house, like for those first few weeks.","startTime":"53:25","endTime":"53:29","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so if you think of that, where most companies shut down, Instacart had unlimited demand.","startTime":"53:29","endTime":"53:35","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so we didn't have time, so we didn't have any recruiting because were like, we're so.","startTime":"53:35","endTime":"53:39","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We don't have time to recruit to interview people.","startTime":"53:40","endTime":"53:42","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We're so busy keeping the systems alive and working.","startTime":"53:42","endTime":"53:44","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But we did have to hire a lot of shoppers.","startTime":"53:44","endTime":"53:46","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And at the time we had just got the app into the app store and kind of had this couch to cash thing that we had worked on where it's like, how quickly can you get onboarded as a shopper, use an Apple Pay or Android Pay to load the credit card that you had to buy the groceries onto your phone, do the background checks, all in parallels, you're going to the store.","startTime":"53:46","endTime":"54:01","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like a bunch of optimizations that are pretty cool.","startTime":"54:01","endTime":"54:03","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so we bring all these people in and we're literally hiring shoppers at this crazy rate, right?","startTime":"54:04","endTime":"54:10","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And what's wild is that the shoppers were coming from all kinds of different, like longshoremen, like people that were traditionally, you would never think as an Instacart shopper because this was the only job, like where, you know, you're still hiring.","startTime":"54:10","endTime":"54:22","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"When so many restaurants and food service and entertainment and just, you know, most sort of jobs of this caliber shut down.","startTime":"54:22","endTime":"54:28","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Instacart was like, no, you could open the app and same day be able to start working.","startTime":"54:28","endTime":"54:32","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right?","startTime":"54:32","endTime":"54:33","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so we had this crazy shopper push.","startTime":"54:33","endTime":"54:35","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We hired, you know, millions and just tons and tons of people right during this peak.","startTime":"54:35","endTime":"54:41","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then come out of that, you're like, okay, you finally the world starts to open a little bit and be a little normal.","startTime":"54:41","endTime":"54:46","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You're like, oh crap.","startTime":"54:46","endTime":"54:47","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We, the business is much bigger.","startTime":"54:47","endTime":"54:49","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Our engineering team is deeply understaffed.","startTime":"54:50","endTime":"54:52","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And at that point the hiring shifted to like hiring a lot of people from like the Uber, the Facebook, Google, those kind of like traditional fan stuff in the Valley because a, we had remoted become a thing.","startTime":"54:53","endTime":"55:04","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But also you were looking for experienced people that could jump in right away.","startTime":"55:04","endTime":"55:07","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right?","startTime":"55:07","endTime":"55:08","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"55:08","endTime":"55:08","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so again, you know, sort of a factory of like, how do we hire, how do we optimize and how do we hire the best people?","startTime":"55:08","endTime":"55:14","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Very quickly we had a lot more opportunity because the world had changed and Instacart had gotten so much bigger.","startTime":"55:14","endTime":"55:19","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And the brand was known because most people have heard of or Tried Instacart, at least in North America during that time.","startTime":"55:19","endTime":"55:25","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"55:25","endTime":"55:26","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then like, how, like, I would imagine the back end and the infra was held together by duct tape at this point in time, I'd imagine.","startTime":"55:27","endTime":"55:36","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"55:36","endTime":"55:36","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So like, how do you go from that to putting systems in place to like, okay, now let's actually build something.","startTime":"55:36","endTime":"55:44","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Or like, what was the state when you joined?","startTime":"55:44","endTime":"55:46","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like, was like, what was it?","startTime":"55:46","endTime":"55:48","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like, this is pretty good.","startTime":"55:48","endTime":"55:50","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Or like, oh, this is kind of an MVP level.","startTime":"55:50","endTime":"55:52","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like it kind of works, but not really.","startTime":"55:52","endTime":"55:54","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like, where.","startTime":"55:54","endTime":"55:54","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Where would you start out?","startTime":"55:55","endTime":"55:56","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, I think it's a good question.","startTime":"55:56","endTime":"55:57","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it was Ruby on Rails, mostly on postgres databases.","startTime":"55:57","endTime":"56:00","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so it worked well, but it was like mono repo kind of style.","startTime":"56:00","endTime":"56:06","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Wasn't microservices.","startTime":"56:06","endTime":"56:07","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we moved some of the stuff to microservices.","startTime":"56:07","endTime":"56:08","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think on the consumer side, it was a much trickier transition because of the, you know, website integrated with the code in the back end.","startTime":"56:09","endTime":"56:16","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"On the fulfillment side, we had a lot more async stuff because a lot of the planning, we had the mobile app, a lot of the, like, traffic.","startTime":"56:16","endTime":"56:22","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There was no website really, other than for hiring.","startTime":"56:22","endTime":"56:24","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"On the shopper side, it was the mobile app.","startTime":"56:25","endTime":"56:26","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And the mobile app obviously gave us some ability to offload that load because a lot of the calculations and things happened on the phone and then a lot of the systems for like, planning and deliveries and things like that were a little more async, although strained.","startTime":"56:26","endTime":"56:37","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But the thing that I got into this loop and probably infamous for during the COVID points was just literally screaming in the phone to my partners and team is like, keep the front door open.","startTime":"56:37","endTime":"56:47","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"How do we take orders and how do we deliver more orders today than we did yesterday?","startTime":"56:47","endTime":"56:52","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that what kept us from delivering more orders.","startTime":"56:52","endTime":"56:55","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it was, some days it was tech, some days that we, you know, the front page of the website went down.","startTime":"56:55","endTime":"57:01","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So weren't able to take orders, which if we can't take them, we can't deliver them.","startTime":"57:01","endTime":"57:04","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then on the delivery side, we did all kinds of creative things of like, how do we increase the batches so the shoppers can shop for five customers and not just two or three?","startTime":"57:04","endTime":"57:12","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"How do we enable, you know, driving distance and rings and how do we open earlier?","startTime":"57:13","endTime":"57:17","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we would, went and negotiated with retailers.","startTime":"57:17","endTime":"57:19","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We would actually have people coming in the back doors of Costco and they had to wear orange vests.","startTime":"57:19","endTime":"57:23","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They didn't get hit by the forklifts because getting more people into the store, more shoppers into the store earlier allowed us to shop more orders.","startTime":"57:23","endTime":"57:29","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"57:29","endTime":"57:30","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Just physically hours of checkout and then other things around, like delivery planning and like, you know, hey, how do we make this thing?","startTime":"57:30","endTime":"57:38","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Or there were certain stores where were tracking if the store was limiting the number of people to go in the store because there was lines.","startTime":"57:38","endTime":"57:44","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And like Covid, we would stop sending shoppers to that store.","startTime":"57:44","endTime":"57:48","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We would close orders at that store and be like, look, if I can't get into this organic grocer because they're being very aggressive about like not letting more people in the store, I'm going to send more orders to Safeway and just shut down that store and take.","startTime":"57:48","endTime":"58:01","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because again, the goal was how do we get more people, more food in the day that we had?","startTime":"58:01","endTime":"58:05","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so the scaling there was, you know, a lot more.","startTime":"58:06","endTime":"58:10","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Honestly, there was tech involved for sure.","startTime":"58:10","endTime":"58:12","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But to me, I think the big win was being able to strategically think about what was the limiting factor and just hyper focus the team on that limiting factor that day to solve it so that the next day that block was not the blocker.","startTime":"58:12","endTime":"58:25","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And sometimes the same thing would come back up.","startTime":"58:25","endTime":"58:27","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Other times it was different things where, you know, oh, these databases are hot.","startTime":"58:27","endTime":"58:31","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"How do we move away from, you know, more aggressive functionality that's eating up CPU or databases and just move to the basic thing?","startTime":"58:31","endTime":"58:38","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"How do we remove, like the perfect solution for the,

yeah.","startTime":"01:03:52","endTime":"01:03:53","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think for us it was always like we had this, you know, 60,000 grocery stores in North

there's nothing worse than going to a website and seeing it slow and then having like, bad SEO or bad, you know, like people find things through Google or whatever, search engine, or even now with chat gbt, like, you're still finding stuff through search.","startTime":"01:03:58","endTime":"01:04:14","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's just that they're running the search for you and still bub those links.","startTime":"01:04:14","endTime":"01:04:17","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so to me, that's always something that I look at and I get annoyed when I.","startTime":"01:04:17","endTime":"01:04:21","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"When like, web tech is shitty because I'm like, this is a solved

lighthouse scores to 100.","startTime":"01:04:26","endTime":"01:04:29","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so we did a ton with like, optimizing a lot of the front pages when I was working on growth at Instacart for a minute around, you know, how do we make sure that those pages are really well done, that they're fast and arguably built a couple layers in front of it because, say, look like we can just make those landing pages really fast.","startTime":"01:04:29","endTime":"01:04:47","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then once you get into the big, like, sort of, you know, kind of the fatter JavaScript app where you're actually ordering, then you can of course have all the functionality and take the time to load.","startTime":"01:04:47","endTime":"01:04:55","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But how do you do that intelligently?","startTime":"01:04:55","endTime":"01:04:57","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so I think that was always something that, you know, made a big difference by having those, you know, really fast, sort of easy to get to landing pages to capture users and help people get to the site and sort of see what we have and see what we offer and then from there be able to, you know, navigate into the bigger app.","startTime":"01:04:57","endTime":"01:05:12","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And even today with like, other companies,

right.","startTime":"01:05:22","endTime":"01:05:23","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And like, most of the things that we're doing have some digital or web footprint and

Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And yeah, I just think it's something that's important to actually have another company in this space that's working doing web performance for that exact thing, which is like helping companies, you know, just optimize their web stuff and their landing pages.","startTime":"01:05:41","endTime":"01:05:54","speaker_name":"Kevin

companies.","startTime":"01:07:54","endTime":"01:07:56","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I'm just going to replace every role with AI, an AI agent.","startTime":"01:07:56","endTime":"01:08:00","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so I think the idea that becomes way more possible today because I think we've both used AI a lot in our businesses and some of the other companies we're building around AI voice and chatbots and things like that.","startTime":"01:08:00","endTime":"01:08:13","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"In my portfolio, like is the idea that I can give you 80, 90% authority or knowledge on any topic.","startTime":"01:08:13","endTime":"01:08:21","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like you can literally top in, you know, the old days was like you'd Google something and get an article or list.","startTime":"01:08:21","endTime":"01:08:25","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Now you can go to deep search and have it like read a report and be like, hey, teach me everything about this.","startTime":"01:08:25","endTime":"01:08:30","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it literally can look that up on medical, legal, corporate, really isoteric, small like things.","startTime":"01:08:30","endTime":"01:08:36","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The ability for then to go from like kind of quick rip to 80% to getting to 100% is a lot harder, right?","startTime":"01:08:37","endTime":"01:08:43","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That last sort of 10, 20% a lot trickier.","startTime":"01:08:43","endTime":"01:08:45","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I think that's going to get easier and easier of more of these tools, both code and no code.","startTime":"01:08:45","endTime":"01:08:52","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And SDK is an open source stuff and been looking at a lot of different tools in that space to sort of play with this.","startTime":"01:08:52","endTime":"01:09:00","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And to me the idea that just taking digital businesses that are already like computer, website, keyboard, like there's no physical thing, it's all digital.","startTime":"01:09:00","endTime":"01:09:11","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And being able to like kind of AI and automate and apply systems to that is like pretty easy.","startTime":"01:09:11","endTime":"01:09:17","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think where it's really exciting is going to businesses where there's still a lot of like labor and a lot of human.","startTime":"01:09:17","endTime":"01:09:22","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And how do you sort of like use AI to help accelerate their businesses?","startTime":"01:09:22","endTime":"01:09:26","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And for some of these businesses that are already growing quicker, where we're seeing the results is we're like going in and saying, hey, well if your business is growing 34, 30 or 40% a year and you're having to add 30 or 40% new staff, can we use AI to just make your current staff more efficient?","startTime":"01:09:26","endTime":"01:09:42","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so your margins actually increase.","startTime":"01:09:42","endTime":"01:09:44","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You can still keep growing at 30, 40%, but maybe you're only having to add 10% people, right?","startTime":"01:09:44","endTime":"01:09:49","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"In digital businesses we see this all the time, right?","startTime":"01:09:50","endTime":"01:09:52","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Really small teams can grow really big because it's all digital.","startTime":"01:09:52","endTime":"01:09:55","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But when the business is like medical services, you know, health care and things of that nature, it's like, well, for every doctor you hire, you have to hire two nurses and three front desk people or operations people.","startTime":"01:09:55","endTime":"01:10:06","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Can we somehow make it so that you're still hiring the doctors and the nurses that are providing patient services but can you sort of reduce the number of like back office and front office folks and using AI to make those people more efficient?","startTime":"01:10:06","endTime":"01:10:19","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so I think that's a lot of the opportunities we're seeing today.","startTime":"01:10:19","endTime":"01:10:21","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think the thing that, you know, personally we're spending most of the time on my own portfolio is just like I said, buying like more digital first companies and applying AI.","startTime":"01:10:21","endTime":"01:10:28","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I think in some of the businesses that, where we're helping, you know, kind of what I would call traditional companies with AI, it's much more the latter where it's like, hey, how do you use AI not necessarily to replace humans, but to augment those humans so that the humans can work on the higher value sort of critical thinking solutions, design and sort of, you know, patient interface or customer interface stuff where they need to like have like, you know, you want to talk to a human, you're not going to walk in and talk to a screen or a robot and let AI sort of solve a lot of those other pieces.","startTime":"01:10:29","endTime":"01:10:59","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"How, how much of like your, I mean, when you look at these companies, I would imagine many of these companies, their tech stack, I mean that's large what you buy.","startTime":"01:10:59","endTime":"01:11:09","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like you buy the tech stack, the software and like I guess the go to market, I guess in some sense.","startTime":"01:11:09","endTime":"01:11:13","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"01:11:13","endTime":"01:11:13","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But customer base, potentially.","startTime":"01:11:13","endTime":"01:11:15","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, customer base, yeah, of course, Yeah.","startTime":"01:11:15","endTime":"01:11:17","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I mean, what's the crazy thing you've seen so far?","startTime":"01:11:17","endTime":"01:11:20","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like what?","startTime":"01:11:20","endTime":"01:11:21","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like you're like, holy shit, this is just, I could, we can solve this in like 15 minutes and like we can turn this thing around.","startTime":"01:11:21","endTime":"01:11:28","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"01:11:28","endTime":"01:11:29","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I would say in some of the bigger companies that we've helped, I think it's around like things that are still done on paper.","startTime":"01:11:29","endTime":"01:11:37","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You know, it's like anything when you're printing something that ends up getting scanned, you're like, why did you print it?","startTime":"01:11:37","endTime":"01:11:44","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And how do we like, you know, so it's almost like things like a Docusign or, you know, or Dropbox Sign can solve.","startTime":"01:11:44","endTime":"01:11:51","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I think those are just.","startTime":"01:11:52","endTime":"01:11:53","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There's still a lot of processes that are not digital.","startTime":"01:11:53","endTime":"01:11:56","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I think that's like one big, so low tech.","startTime":"01:11:56","endTime":"01:11:58","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like I wouldn't even think of that like as innovation because it's so rudimentary to our life.","startTime":"01:11:58","endTime":"01:12:04","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"01:12:04","endTime":"01:12:04","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And part of that is that if you think about it, the old model is that by keeping it on paper, it never got into a computer.","startTime":"01:12:04","endTime":"01:12:11","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So there's no SaaS, there's no form, it's not even in a database.","startTime":"01:12:11","endTime":"01:12:14","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But the thing with AI, it's like, well now you can take that form exactly the way it is, not even have to rewrite the form or change it.","startTime":"01:12:14","endTime":"01:12:21","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And AI can extract the value out of it and put it in a database or do the next thing without even putting it in a database.","startTime":"01:12:21","endTime":"01:12:26","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so I think that piece of it is where like AI is allowing you to like digitize things that in the process you're like, oh, if we digitize this paper thing, all we'd end up with is a bunch of scans in a Dropbox folder.","startTime":"01:12:26","endTime":"01:12:37","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Not really useful.","startTime":"01:12:37","endTime":"01:12:38","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But now if you're like, no, we can process them, categorize them, use them, do the next stage in the process.","startTime":"01:12:38","endTime":"01:12:44","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think pretty cool.","startTime":"01:12:44","endTime":"01:12:46","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think the other one where we're seeing it is just call centers with some of the voice customers we're working with.","startTime":"01:12:47","endTime":"01:12:51","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You know, how can you help?","startTime":"01:12:52","endTime":"01:12:53","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like the first version of like AI voice and like IVRs people hate like you get on any phone call, you're like agent.","startTime":"01:12:53","endTime":"01:13:00","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You know, we've zero.","startTime":"01:13:00","endTime":"01:13:01","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Zero agent.","startTime":"01:13:01","endTime":"01:13:02","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, you just want to get rid of the computer to get to a human.","startTime":"01:13:02","endTime":"01:13:05","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But now some of the stuff and we've rolled out, people prefer talking to the agent, which is crazy because they're deeply empathetic, they're incredibly persistent and patient and that you can literally ask them anything.","startTime":"01:13:05","endTime":"01:13:17","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They have every answer that's, you know, that is known to the company.","startTime":"01:13:18","endTime":"01:13:21","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I think as those kind of voice solutions start to get into more customers, people start to trust them more and start to be actually be okay with that because they're actually providing a solution.","startTime":"01:13:21","endTime":"01:13:31","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Just like today, you and I, if I know there's an app or a website, I typically will prefer to use that than call on the phone.","startTime":"01:13:31","endTime":"01:13:37","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"01:13:37","endTime":"01:13:38","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"100.","startTime":"01:13:38","endTime":"01:13:38","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Even if the phone might be faster if you got the right person, the chance of getting the right person is so low.","startTime":"01:13:38","endTime":"01:13:44","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So now imagine a world where just like voice to text.","startTime":"01:13:44","endTime":"01:13:48","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If I could call the number and it was as good as the best mobile site or web or mobile app, I would actually do it because it's faster for me to call.","startTime":"01:13:48","endTime":"01:13:55","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I can be on a run, I can be out, you know, my car.","startTime":"01:13:55","endTime":"01:13:58","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I'm not tied to like being at a computer or an app.","startTime":"01:13:58","endTime":"01:14:00","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I literally can be hands free and talk to the thing and it does the right thing.","startTime":"01:14:00","endTime":"01:14:04","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so I think there's a lot of value and we've seen this with our early customers already, that they're getting a ton of like savings, but also like they're actually providing a better solution to their End customers.","startTime":"01:14:05","endTime":"01:14:16","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think the voice idea is very interesting because, I mean, I don't think voice technology has changed that much, at least not for processing.","startTime":"01:14:16","endTime":"01:14:27","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Voice has changed that much in the last like five years.","startTime":"01:14:27","endTime":"01:14:31","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But what has changed is processing that voice.","startTime":"01:14:31","endTime":"01:14:34","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"01:14:34","endTime":"01:14:35","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So now like you can just talk and it, with the fault tolerance is kind of consumed by the LLM and contextual.","startTime":"01:14:35","endTime":"01:14:42","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It can like compensate for that.","startTime":"01:14:43","endTime":"01:14:44","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"01:14:44","endTime":"01:14:45","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And that is a huge shift, I think, and makes it so much more usable than it used to be.","startTime":"01:14:45","endTime":"01:14:50","speaker_name":"Viktor

Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There's a couple people working on it.","startTime":"01:14:55","endTime":"01:14:56","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it's still like voice to text to voice.","startTime":"01:14:56","endTime":"01:14:59","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Kind of like is where a lot of the real time stuff happens.","startTime":"01:15:00","endTime":"01:15:03","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that's what we're deploying today.","startTime":"01:15:03","endTime":"01:15:04","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But we're going to see voice to voice in the next year.","startTime":"01:15:05","endTime":"01:15:08","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's going to start to get good.","startTime":"01:15:08","endTime":"01:15:09","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then the question is like, can we build enough of the intelligence in there to really see that as something that people can deploy at scale?","startTime":"01:15:09","endTime":"01:15:16","speaker_name":"Kevin Henrikson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because right now the stuff that we're deploying at scale is working, but there's still a lot, there's a lot of pieces to the puzzle.","startTime":"01:15:16","endTime":"01:15:22","speaker_name":"Kevin
