[{"sentence":"Hello everybody, and welcome to this episode of Nerding out to Victor.","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"00:03","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Today I got a very good friend of mine on the show that we got no doubt about something he has been working on for the last six months or so or 12 months probably by now.","startTime":"00:03","endTime":"00:12","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And just to give some backstory, Dom is an author and wrote the book Web of Things and invented a concept of Web of Things.","startTime":"00:12","endTime":"00:20","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"He's the co founder of Everything that was later acquired by digimark.","startTime":"00:20","endTime":"00:25","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And Dom, do you want to say a few words that are probably missed in your introduction about your backstory?","startTime":"00:25","endTime":"00:30","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"No, I think that's it.","startTime":"00:32","endTime":"00:33","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Very happy to be on the show, of course.","startTime":"00:33","endTime":"00:36","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And yeah, today indeed, Everything was acquired by digimark.","startTime":"00:37","endTime":"00:41","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I'm the VP of innovation at digimark where I work on all kind of innovation projects, including our involvement with standards.","startTime":"00:41","endTime":"00:50","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I've been working on standards almost my entire career.","startTime":"00:50","endTime":"00:54","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I don't really like standards, to be honest, but I like the power of standards.","startTime":"00:54","endTime":"01:00","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that's why I keep working on those, actually.","startTime":"01:00","endTime":"01:04","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Very cool.","startTime":"01:04","endTime":"01:05","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So today's episode we're going to talk about something called C2PA, which is a part of what, which is similar to verify credentials.","startTime":"01:05","endTime":"01:13","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And we got dive into what these two things are in detail throughout the course of this episode.","startTime":"01:13","endTime":"01:19","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But maybe we should start Dom, and doing a quick introduction.","startTime":"01:19","endTime":"01:23","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What even is this and why does it even matter?","startTime":"01:23","endTime":"01:26","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, sure.","startTime":"01:27","endTime":"01:28","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I was thinking I could share a few slides maybe.","startTime":"01:28","endTime":"01:32","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Let's do it.","startTime":"01:32","endTime":"01:33","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That's not what I want.","startTime":"01:35","endTime":"01:37","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"PowerPoint.","startTime":"01:37","endTime":"01:38","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, let's just go that way.","startTime":"01:38","endTime":"01:40","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"01:40","endTime":"01:41","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So, you know, I think I'm not going to break the news by saying that generative AI has been changing pretty much everything lately.","startTime":"01:41","endTime":"01:52","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And in particular, it has made understanding what is real and what isn't, what is generated and what isn't really hard.","startTime":"01:54","endTime":"02:04","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean, there are lots of examples of that.","startTime":"02:04","endTime":"02:08","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And the one on.","startTime":"02:08","endTime":"02:09","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, exactly.","startTime":"02:10","endTime":"02:11","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The one on the bottom right is probably one of the most famous examples.","startTime":"02:11","endTime":"02:15","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But there were other examples that were even a bit more impactful, like the bombing of the Pentagon, which led to a dip in the stock market and was actually a deep fake.","startTime":"02:15","endTime":"02:28","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that's one side of the medal.","startTime":"02:30","endTime":"02:34","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The other side of the medal is in the upper part.","startTime":"02:34","endTime":"02:37","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There is that content creators have their content being used by these generative AI tools for no compensation.","startTime":"02:37","endTime":"02:46","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So these genai tools are basically taking any content and then using it to generate other images.","startTime":"02:46","endTime":"02:54","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we have this kind of dual side of the issue.","startTime":"02:54","endTime":"03:00","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And C2PA is basically answer to at least a partial answer to these questions and to these things that Genai is raising.","startTime":"03:01","endTime":"03:12","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it's basically about looking at protecting the intellectual property of creators, and we'll probably deep dive into that, but it's not protecting it necessarily in a DRM way, but basically informing any user or any tool of who owns the copyright.","startTime":"03:12","endTime":"03:31","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And the second part is about reestablishing trust in digital content.","startTime":"03:33","endTime":"03:38","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think that's really the core of where the standard is going.","startTime":"03:39","endTime":"03:41","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And the core value of the standard is to allow users to get provenance information about the assets they're looking at, to know where it came from, how was it modified, who created it, whether or not it was generated by AI.","startTime":"03:42","endTime":"03:58","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so C2PA created a set of standards.","startTime":"03:58","endTime":"04:01","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They are now known more as content credentials.","startTime":"04:02","endTime":"04:05","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's the marketing term for C2PA standards, content credentials.","startTime":"04:05","endTime":"04:10","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And essentially it's metadata that's attached to assets.","startTime":"04:11","endTime":"04:14","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you have the asset and then you have the metadata attached to it.","startTime":"04:15","endTime":"04:20","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"For instance, in the case of JPEG images, it's via the EXIF headers.","startTime":"04:20","endTime":"04:25","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But other formats are supported, images are supported, video are supported, and now text, as well as documents.","startTime":"04:25","endTime":"04:33","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I think one thing to call out is that the recent US Executive Order on Artificial Intelligence is starting to mandate the creation of such tools, the creation of standards around the authenticity of digital content and also the labeling of synthetic content.","startTime":"04:33","endTime":"04:51","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And they mentioned C2PA, but they also mentioned tools like digital watermarking, where obviously digimark has a lot of expertise.","startTime":"04:52","endTime":"04:59","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that's the crux of C2.","startTime":"05:00","endTime":"05:04","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Paul.","startTime":"05:04","endTime":"05:05","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right, so let's zoom in on this.","startTime":"05:05","endTime":"05:07","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like, who really cares about this?","startTime":"05:07","endTime":"05:08","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right, because that's the big question.","startTime":"05:08","endTime":"05:10","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"This is cool, but who's this for?","startTime":"05:11","endTime":"05:13","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And who do you think really cares about this?","startTime":"05:13","endTime":"05:17","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, it's a good point.","startTime":"05:19","endTime":"05:21","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think ultimately everyone should care about it.","startTime":"05:22","endTime":"05:25","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Whether we all care about it today is a big question.","startTime":"05:25","endTime":"05:28","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I think the tools are still maturing.","startTime":"05:28","endTime":"05:31","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's not like C2P is widely deployed yet.","startTime":"05:31","endTime":"05:34","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's proliferating very quickly.","startTime":"05:34","endTime":"05:36","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But it's not like every single Image has a C2Pmanifest that you can check.","startTime":"05:36","endTime":"05:40","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I don't know if it will ever be the case.","startTime":"05:40","endTime":"05:43","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think it's more for images that have high value.","startTime":"05:43","endTime":"05:47","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I can really imagine.","startTime":"05:49","endTime":"05:50","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And there's a lot of traction in the, in the news industry around that because obviously that is things, you know, the news we see are things we.","startTime":"05:50","endTime":"06:01","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Information we really want to be able to trust.","startTime":"06:01","endTime":"06:03","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that's a really a core value of C2PA.","startTime":"06:04","endTime":"06:10","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think yeah, I think ultimately everyone will be a user, whether we'll be active users or simply we'll have that little PIN icon appearing and we'll look at it like half look at it and we'll look at it when something seems fishy or whether you are a content creator.","startTime":"06:10","endTime":"06:27","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I think content creators are all the core users of C2PA because they want to be able to stamp their content, apply their credentials and their copyright to it, and also they want to make sure it's not manipulated without their consent, actually.","startTime":"06:27","endTime":"06:45","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"06:45","endTime":"06:46","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But it's really like a catch 22 or a network problem, really at its core it's not valuable until it's very largely deployed because unless you have this as part of essentially every image, it's hard to maintain much trust, I guess, in a sense.","startTime":"06:46","endTime":"07:08","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"07:08","endTime":"07:08","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So it's a bit of a difficult one because if you have a photo without that, you can't.","startTime":"07:08","endTime":"07:14","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I guess it's a positive indicator if you do have it, but it doesn't mean that it isn't valid just because it doesn't have that.","startTime":"07:15","endTime":"07:21","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"If that makes sense.","startTime":"07:21","endTime":"07:22","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, yeah.","startTime":"07:24","endTime":"07:25","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean, apologies.","startTime":"07:25","endTime":"07:29","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yes, you're right.","startTime":"07:30","endTime":"07:31","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean, and I think it's really a question of network effect and we need to have enough images that have these credentials because an image that doesn't have a credential, that doesn't have content credentials, then how do you judge it?","startTime":"07:31","endTime":"07:47","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"07:47","endTime":"07:48","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So, yeah, I think the critical mass is important.","startTime":"07:48","endTime":"07:50","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What I'll just say is that there are really strong forces behind C2PA has been driven by Adobe, Microsoft, BBC, intel and others.","startTime":"07:51","endTime":"08:02","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So there's really a big uptake, it's going to take time and ultimately I think it will start in places where we really need to have trusted content.","startTime":"08:02","endTime":"08:14","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I can think of the US elections, for instance, a good example.","startTime":"08:14","endTime":"08:17","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it, you know, but it has to start somewhere and I think it's proliferating quickly.","startTime":"08:18","endTime":"08:25","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But you're right for journalism, I completely understand it, like to be able to trust like a BBC, whatever reputable news outlet, they need to be verified this and so that.","startTime":"08:25","endTime":"08:35","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It makes a lot of sense.","startTime":"08:35","endTime":"08:36","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"08:36","endTime":"08:36","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I'm thinking more like a general use case on the Internet at large.","startTime":"08:36","endTime":"08:40","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And it's a bit of a mis in match incentives in some ways.","startTime":"08:40","endTime":"08:46","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"08:46","endTime":"08:47","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because the average user probably do not care too much about it in general.","startTime":"08:47","endTime":"08:52","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"08:52","endTime":"08:52","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Unless they're affected by it, which is kind of the.","startTime":"08:52","endTime":"08:55","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"If it's deep fakes, for instance.","startTime":"08:55","endTime":"08:57","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I guess we tie the conversation to deepfakes, which is one of the Main areas I guess trying to address here is for this to really work, you need to basically enforce all gen AI toolings to do kind of watermarking that it is a gen AI tool and that's kind of a misincentive for some of these tools.","startTime":"08:57","endTime":"09:19","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And maybe you can get OpenAI to do it and some of the bigger US firms to do it.","startTime":"09:19","endTime":"09:23","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But will the open source LLMs do this?","startTime":"09:23","endTime":"09:27","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"How are you thinking about that or how do you see about that?","startTime":"09:27","endTime":"09:30","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, so.","startTime":"09:33","endTime":"09:34","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I think we need to look at two angles, right.","startTime":"09:34","endTime":"09:38","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The one angle is that C2PA can help LLMs and Gen AI providers flagging their content as AI generated.","startTime":"09:39","endTime":"09:48","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's one side.","startTime":"09:48","endTime":"09:50","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There are other technologies that can help.","startTime":"09:50","endTime":"09:52","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"For instance, the Executive order is citing watermarking, which is another way to help.","startTime":"09:52","endTime":"09:57","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I think we can talk about the differences and the strengths of each technology.","startTime":"09:57","endTime":"10:01","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So yeah, I think them adopting it is primarily a question of regulation, I'd say.","startTime":"10:03","endTime":"10:11","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So legislation will certainly work for companies and like OpenAI.","startTime":"10:12","endTime":"10:18","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I'm thinking like Dall E or some great video generation like Synthesia and companies like that do video content generation using AI.","startTime":"10:18","endTime":"10:28","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But you can't really enforce stuff open source and that's a bit challenging, I guess, because they're not really entities that you can enforce thus for.","startTime":"10:28","endTime":"10:37","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"In the same way.","startTime":"10:37","endTime":"10:38","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"No, but open source projects still have to respect the regulation in place.","startTime":"10:40","endTime":"10:44","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I.","startTime":"10:44","endTime":"10:45","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But they're not enforced globally though.","startTime":"10:45","endTime":"10:47","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So they're US centric, largely.","startTime":"10:47","endTime":"10:49","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You mean the regulations.","startTime":"10:51","endTime":"10:52","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yes.","startTime":"10:52","endTime":"10:53","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The US Executive Order is a US only entity.","startTime":"10:53","endTime":"10:55","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"10:56","endTime":"10:56","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Or US.","startTime":"10:56","endTime":"10:56","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, that's right.","startTime":"10:56","endTime":"10:57","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But there's the.","startTime":"10:57","endTime":"10:58","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There's almost the same kind of regulation that's in preparation in the European Community.","startTime":"10:58","endTime":"11:05","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then there is.","startTime":"11:06","endTime":"11:08","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"11:08","endTime":"11:09","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"China for instance, was the first country to make a move to make it mandatory to watermark content from generative AI.","startTime":"11:09","endTime":"11:17","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So, you know, I don't think it's a US only thing.","startTime":"11:17","endTime":"11:20","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay, so you anticipate this being kind of global legal framework in a sense.","startTime":"11:20","endTime":"11:24","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"11:24","endTime":"11:25","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And they're all similar, in particular the European regulation.","startTime":"11:25","endTime":"11:28","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean, there's no regulation yet, but there are drafts and discussions is going very much along the way of the US Executive Order, which is also not a regulation.","startTime":"11:28","endTime":"11:37","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"11:37","endTime":"11:38","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But a set of guidelines.","startTime":"11:38","endTime":"11:39","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right, right.","startTime":"11:39","endTime":"11:41","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, interesting.","startTime":"11:41","endTime":"11:42","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Let's take a step back.","startTime":"11:43","endTime":"11:44","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Verify credentials and CTPA are kind of similar.","startTime":"11:45","endTime":"11:49","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"My understanding is the VC or verified credentials, they're backed by W3C standard.","startTime":"11:50","endTime":"11:54","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Do you want to walk me through the difference and how they are similar, but how they are different?","startTime":"11:54","endTime":"11:57","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"As well?","startTime":"11:57","endTime":"11:58","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Well, yeah, I don't think they are similar.","startTime":"11:59","endTime":"12:01","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I don't think similar is necessarily the right word.","startTime":"12:02","endTime":"12:05","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think they're very complementary.","startTime":"12:05","endTime":"12:07","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Verifiable credentials.","startTime":"12:07","endTime":"12:09","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"W3C.","startTime":"12:09","endTime":"12:10","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Verifiable credentials basically give.","startTime":"12:10","endTime":"12:12","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Allow you to use identity, decentralized identity did.","startTime":"12:13","endTime":"12:18","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"To sign claims.","startTime":"12:19","endTime":"12:20","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"12:20","endTime":"12:20","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you can now use your credentials to sign claims, all kind of claims.","startTime":"12:20","endTime":"12:25","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"12:25","endTime":"12:25","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it's a generic framework for signing claims, digital claims of all sorts.","startTime":"12:25","endTime":"12:34","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"C2PA is a framework for providing provenance information from and about assets.","startTime":"12:35","endTime":"12:42","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Now, the place where they meet and will meet in a more tightly coupled way in the future is that to be able to provide provenance information about assets.","startTime":"12:43","endTime":"12:53","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It is very interesting to be able to sign these provenance information and different claims that you're making about an asset.","startTime":"12:53","endTime":"13:02","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so that's where verifiable credentials meet C2PA.","startTime":"13:02","endTime":"13:07","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And actually they already.","startTime":"13:07","endTime":"13:09","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You can already use verifiable credentials to sign C2PA claims today, but it's not 100% integrated yet.","startTime":"13:10","endTime":"13:21","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I know that work in the next version of C2PA will make this a lot more supported in a lot better way.","startTime":"13:21","endTime":"13:31","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay, so it's a kind of semi related, substandard, but not exactly the same C2PA can fit into the framework of VCs in the long run, in a sense.","startTime":"13:31","endTime":"13:43","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"13:43","endTime":"13:43","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And you know, C2PA started before verifiable credentials or actually almost at the same time.","startTime":"13:43","endTime":"13:53","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And within the C2PA community, there's no an understanding of the power of verifiable credentials.","startTime":"13:53","endTime":"13:59","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so there's an evolution to start to adopt that for signing claims.","startTime":"13:59","endTime":"14:05","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"14:05","endTime":"14:06","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, interesting.","startTime":"14:06","endTime":"14:07","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"One thing that I found interesting was the hardware integration in cameras for the, sort of.","startTime":"14:07","endTime":"14:13","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"For the C2PA standard.","startTime":"14:13","endTime":"14:15","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You want to talk a bit about that?","startTime":"14:15","endTime":"14:16","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because I think that's super powerful.","startTime":"14:16","endTime":"14:17","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, I think that's very powerful.","startTime":"14:18","endTime":"14:20","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The closer to the source you are, the better it is.","startTime":"14:20","endTime":"14:22","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You don't want to be too late in the workflow to add a manifest to your assets.","startTime":"14:22","endTime":"14:28","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so being able to add it to the cameras is a wonderful idea.","startTime":"14:28","endTime":"14:32","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I had the chance a couple of weeks ago.","startTime":"14:32","endTime":"14:35","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I was at Stanford for the CAI summit, so the C2PA community summit and Leica was present there.","startTime":"14:35","endTime":"14:42","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I tested the.","startTime":"14:42","endTime":"14:44","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think it's the M11 Leica camera that has native C2PA capability.","startTime":"14:44","endTime":"14:50","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So literally you configure a camera to say who you are, that generates a key for you and then that key is used to sign the claims and Basically whenever you take a picture, it basically certifies that it was taken by this camera at this time.","startTime":"14:50","endTime":"15:05","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You can even add things like geolocation and so on.","startTime":"15:05","endTime":"15:08","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"15:08","endTime":"15:09","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you can cryptographically say this photo was taken at this protest and I took it because I cryptographically signed it as a photographer, essentially.","startTime":"15:09","endTime":"15:19","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, exactly.","startTime":"15:19","endTime":"15:20","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then the news outlet can say, oh, actually we know by the mere cryptography of this that it is not tampered with.","startTime":"15:20","endTime":"15:29","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And you can validate that this is actually not a fake.","startTime":"15:29","endTime":"15:32","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I can see that power workflow, end to end being super powerful.","startTime":"15:32","endTime":"15:36","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"15:37","endTime":"15:38","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Cool.","startTime":"15:38","endTime":"15:39","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Now let's dive into technical stuff because I think that's where it really gets interesting.","startTime":"15:39","endTime":"15:45","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"15:45","endTime":"15:45","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So my understanding is there are two elements to the C2 pack.","startTime":"15:46","endTime":"15:51","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"There is the metadata, which can be stored in EXIF, as you mentioned, for JPEGs, for instance, and there is the watermarking feature of this, because if you only store in exif, stripping that out is trivial for anybody with even the basic understanding of tech.","startTime":"15:52","endTime":"16:11","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So walk me through these, the actual technology behind the watermarking.","startTime":"16:11","endTime":"16:18","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Behind the watermarking, you mean behind both.","startTime":"16:20","endTime":"16:22","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The watermarking and the exif, I guess, and how that actually works.","startTime":"16:22","endTime":"16:25","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And we can dive into this to designing and the recovery process in a moment.","startTime":"16:25","endTime":"16:29","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I'm just curious about how it's structured on a big picture level.","startTime":"16:29","endTime":"16:32","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"16:34","endTime":"16:34","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay, so I think I'll share my screen again because I want to show you something because I think it's important to say that today C2PA exists without digital watermarks.","startTime":"16:34","endTime":"16:50","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And there's a bit of confusion on the market and in the news about that because the executive order mentions watermarking.","startTime":"16:50","endTime":"16:57","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The executive order also mentioned other things such as manifests.","startTime":"16:57","endTime":"17:01","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean, they're not the same.","startTime":"17:01","endTime":"17:03","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Currently C2PA is not watermark based.","startTime":"17:04","endTime":"17:07","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So currently in C2PA you basically add manifests to assets.","startTime":"17:07","endTime":"17:13","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And there are a few issues with that.","startTime":"17:13","endTime":"17:16","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Primarily two issues, right, is that you can remove the manifest and we can show that a little later in a little demonstration.","startTime":"17:17","endTime":"17:27","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so if you remove the manifest from the asset, well then it's gone.","startTime":"17:27","endTime":"17:30","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then you have no provenance information about the this asset.","startTime":"17:30","endTime":"17:33","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Another issue is that the manifest can be switched for another manifest.","startTime":"17:35","endTime":"17:39","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So if you're a malicious actor, you can basically strip off the manifest and add a new manifest that's cryptographically going to be perfectly okay, except you just stole my asset or you unflagged an asset that was AI generated and you make it not AI generated in the manifestation.","startTime":"17:39","endTime":"18:00","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"These are the type of attacks that are fairly easy to perform, and the latter.","startTime":"18:01","endTime":"18:06","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So the switch of a manifest is an attack.","startTime":"18:06","endTime":"18:08","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The former, I think, very importantly, is not an attack.","startTime":"18:08","endTime":"18:11","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like if you upload an image that has a C2PA manifest on pretty much any social media platform, then the manifest is going to be stripped off.","startTime":"18:12","endTime":"18:22","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"18:22","endTime":"18:23","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Actually, I did a little experiment not long ago.","startTime":"18:23","endTime":"18:26","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I was writing a blog post about our C2PA extension.","startTime":"18:26","endTime":"18:31","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We launched a C2PA Chrome extension at Digimarc, and I was trying to find one platform that would actually not remove the, you know, the manifest from my images.","startTime":"18:31","endTime":"18:42","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I failed to do so until I realized GitHub doesn't.","startTime":"18:42","endTime":"18:46","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because GitHub is really not touching the images at all.","startTime":"18:46","endTime":"18:50","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"All the other platforms, all the blogging platforms, all the social media platforms are basically stripping the manifesto.","startTime":"18:50","endTime":"18:57","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"For good reasons though, Right?","startTime":"18:58","endTime":"18:59","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because they do it for privacy reasons.","startTime":"18:59","endTime":"19:00","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Largely because EXIF data usually includes location.","startTime":"19:00","endTime":"19:03","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So for safety reasons, most of them do that.","startTime":"19:03","endTime":"19:06","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right, Absolutely.","startTime":"19:06","endTime":"19:08","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I think as creators, the long tail of content creators, we don't necessarily realize what these manifests contain.","startTime":"19:08","endTime":"19:16","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so that's why the social networks and the platforms generally strip them off.","startTime":"19:16","endTime":"19:22","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think some of them, they strip them off consciously, indeed.","startTime":"19:22","endTime":"19:25","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"To preserve privacy.","startTime":"19:25","endTime":"19:27","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Some of the tools just strip them off because they don't, you know, they.","startTime":"19:27","endTime":"19:31","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They don't really mind and they don't really care about ensuring that these manifests are kept.","startTime":"19:31","endTime":"19:37","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that's the case of many photo editing tools, for instance, or image editing tools.","startTime":"19:38","endTime":"19:43","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"19:43","endTime":"19:43","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And they replace it even with their own EXIF data.","startTime":"19:43","endTime":"19:46","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"19:46","endTime":"19:46","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Rotators, for instance.","startTime":"19:46","endTime":"19:47","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"19:47","endTime":"19:48","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"19:48","endTime":"19:48","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think counter example is the Adobe suite of tool.","startTime":"19:48","endTime":"19:52","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Obviously Adobe being such a strong actor behind C2PA, their tools respect the C2PA workflows and they don't remove the manifest.","startTime":"19:52","endTime":"20:00","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But many other tools do.","startTime":"20:00","endTime":"20:02","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right, Right.","startTime":"20:02","endTime":"20:03","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"20:03","endTime":"20:04","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So tying this back into the camera.","startTime":"20:04","endTime":"20:06","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So when you mentioned the Leica cameras supporting exif.","startTime":"20:07","endTime":"20:10","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Sorry, supporting ctpa, is that purely then in the form of exif or are they doing something beyond exif?","startTime":"20:10","endTime":"20:18","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"No, today it's purely in the form of exif.","startTime":"20:19","endTime":"20:22","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And this is when digimarc entered the game.","startTime":"20:22","endTime":"20:26","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it's not like we broke the news in the C2PA community by saying watermarks could help.","startTime":"20:26","endTime":"20:32","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"20:32","endTime":"20:33","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They already imagined watermarks could help.","startTime":"20:33","endTime":"20:35","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And the C2PA standard already has a mechanism called soft binding, which is a way to bind the manifest to the actual image.","startTime":"20:36","endTime":"20:46","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because that's the problem.","startTime":"20:46","endTime":"20:47","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's creating a strong link between, on the one hand side, the manifest, and on the other Hand side the image.","startTime":"20:47","endTime":"20:53","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And they already had defined soft bindings.","startTime":"20:54","endTime":"20:56","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And in soft bindings, they describe two techniques for soft binding.","startTime":"20:56","endTime":"21:00","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"One of them is perceptual hashes and the other one is watermarking.","startTime":"21:00","endTime":"21:04","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But they were just described at a high level.","startTime":"21:04","endTime":"21:06","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So there's nothing in the standard that tells you how to do that just for the sake of completeness.","startTime":"21:07","endTime":"21:13","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"A perceptual hash is unlike a traditional hash, is a hash that if you modify a little bit an image, say for instance, you could still have the same hash.","startTime":"21:13","endTime":"21:26","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Whereas the typical SHA256 hashes, you modify any pixel, you have a completely different hash.","startTime":"21:26","endTime":"21:35","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Perceptual hashes are resilient to some changes.","startTime":"21:35","endTime":"21:38","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So like if you were to crop the image, for instance, you would still retain the hash?","startTime":"21:38","endTime":"21:41","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, I mean, depending on the perceptual hashing algorithm you use.","startTime":"21:42","endTime":"21:46","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But, yeah, it could be resilient to that type of issues.","startTime":"21:46","endTime":"21:49","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So now you have a way, in theory, using a perceptual hash to find a manifest.","startTime":"21:50","endTime":"21:56","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Given an image, you can find if there's a manifest for it.","startTime":"21:56","endTime":"21:59","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I see.","startTime":"21:59","endTime":"22:00","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"22:00","endTime":"22:00","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So that takes me into the next part, which is a big part of it, which is the recovery process of recovering a signature or an owner, really, I guess, for a photo in this case.","startTime":"22:00","endTime":"22:12","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So that's how it works.","startTime":"22:12","endTime":"22:13","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's basically a lookup table based on.","startTime":"22:13","endTime":"22:15","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The hash, essentially based on a perceptual hash.","startTime":"22:15","endTime":"22:18","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But again, the problem with perceptual hashes is that they're very brittle.","startTime":"22:18","endTime":"22:23","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You can have, and there are a couple of interesting blog posts on that.","startTime":"22:25","endTime":"22:28","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You can have drastically different images that give the same perceptual hash.","startTime":"22:28","endTime":"22:34","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Or you can have.","startTime":"22:34","endTime":"22:35","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, well, yeah, it's not even collision, but it's simply the algorithm sees it as the same thing.","startTime":"22:36","endTime":"22:43","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And there are a couple of good examples that we can post.","startTime":"22:43","endTime":"22:50","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The other problem is, yeah, some tiny modifications might actually lead to a different perceptual hash as well.","startTime":"22:50","endTime":"23:01","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's brittle.","startTime":"23:02","endTime":"23:03","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There's another problem, which is it requires an active lookup.","startTime":"23:03","endTime":"23:07","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you have to basically go into a database and you have to query that database and find the corresponding manifest.","startTime":"23:07","endTime":"23:16","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So this is where watermarks, we believe, are a much stronger proposition because you literally embed inside the image an imperceptible signal that ties back to the manifest and that is a lot stronger.","startTime":"23:16","endTime":"23:34","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Also pretty resilient to many of the modifications that you can make.","startTime":"23:34","endTime":"23:39","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right, yeah, he's going back to the hashing of that.","startTime":"23:39","endTime":"23:45","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So that essentially means that in some ways it's void if you can do a fuzzing attack essentially on an image and you can create the same image twice.","startTime":"23:45","endTime":"23:53","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That means that you can impersonate another image and have that look up to the same.","startTime":"23:53","endTime":"23:58","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you can basically fake a real photo with a fake photo from say, a demonstration.","startTime":"23:58","endTime":"24:03","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"24:03","endTime":"24:03","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"With a.","startTime":"24:03","endTime":"24:04","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Presumably not too difficult.","startTime":"24:04","endTime":"24:06","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Well, if you have somewhat decent resources at your disposal, you could fake like a nation state, for instance, could fake a photo from a protest, essentially.","startTime":"24:07","endTime":"24:17","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"In theory, then, yeah, you could start.","startTime":"24:17","endTime":"24:19","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Doing these kind of things.","startTime":"24:19","endTime":"24:20","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You could also, by making tiny modifications to an image, making it impossible to find the.","startTime":"24:20","endTime":"24:26","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"To find the manifest, the original manifest.","startTime":"24:26","endTime":"24:28","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you could make things that are generated by AI flag that's not generated by AI.","startTime":"24:29","endTime":"24:34","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So yeah, you could perform all kinds of things.","startTime":"24:34","endTime":"24:36","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, I guess there's no way to.","startTime":"24:37","endTime":"24:39","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, there's no way to detect that it is a collision.","startTime":"24:39","endTime":"24:41","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"24:41","endTime":"24:41","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because you don't really know unless you have pointed to the original image where you actually upload the original image as well.","startTime":"24:41","endTime":"24:47","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So then you have a reference to what the real is.","startTime":"24:47","endTime":"24:50","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Even if you have a collision.","startTime":"24:50","endTime":"24:51","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You can say, oh, actually these images are off the same.","startTime":"24:51","endTime":"24:53","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"24:55","endTime":"24:55","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If you can establish they're the same and you can tie it back to the original image, then yeah, you could.","startTime":"24:55","endTime":"25:00","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So there's no this database.","startTime":"25:01","endTime":"25:02","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Are you speaking up here?","startTime":"25:02","endTime":"25:03","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So that's only like a text database, essentially, with the metadata.","startTime":"25:03","endTime":"25:06","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It doesn't have a reference to the real image of any way, shape or form.","startTime":"25:06","endTime":"25:10","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"25:10","endTime":"25:10","speaker_name":"Viktor

implementation.","startTime":"25:13","endTime":"25:15","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It could also have the reference image.","startTime":"25:15","endTime":"25:18","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, interesting.","startTime":"25:18","endTime":"25:19","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay, cool.","startTime":"25:19","endTime":"25:20","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"All right, let's go into the watermark, because I think that's a lot more interesting and far more bulletproof.","startTime":"25:20","endTime":"25:26","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"25:26","endTime":"25:27","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So let's talk a bit about the watermarking, how that actually could work and how.","startTime":"25:27","endTime":"25:30","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Well, I guess Digitmark is working on that to solve that problem.","startTime":"25:30","endTime":"25:34","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, so with the idea of the watermark is that you basically, again, create that strong link between the image and the manifest because you embed inside the image an imperceptible signal that ties it back to the manifest.","startTime":"25:35","endTime":"25:53","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So now if you basically decouple the image from its manifest, then the watermark says, hey, well, actually there is a manifest for this image, and here is where you can find a manifest or even here is the actual manifest.","startTime":"25:53","endTime":"26:09","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you can implement a recovery process based on.","startTime":"26:09","endTime":"26:12","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Based on the watermark.","startTime":"26:12","endTime":"26:14","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"26:14","endTime":"26:15","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And watermark, I mean, that's.","startTime":"26:15","endTime":"26:17","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That's nothing new.","startTime":"26:17","endTime":"26:17","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"26:18","endTime":"26:18","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That's been all the big stock photo imagery site, they've been toying with these things for Quite some time.","startTime":"26:18","endTime":"26:23","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"26:23","endTime":"26:23","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because that's a major problem they have.","startTime":"26:23","endTime":"26:25","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So, so walk me through the unique approach I guess that digimark is taking on this compared to what's been using for the, for some while.","startTime":"26:25","endTime":"26:35","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"For some while to do attribution on images in watermarks.","startTime":"26:35","endTime":"26:38","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, it's true that watermarking is a, you know, set of technologies that exists for a while.","startTime":"26:39","endTime":"26:45","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think the real USP of Digimark is the experience.","startTime":"26:45","endTime":"26:49","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Digimark has been one of the pioneers for more than 20 years in the watermarking space.","startTime":"26:49","endTime":"26:54","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"An example is helping the world central banks with watermarking and we have helped all kinds of companies in the digital space, in the physical space.","startTime":"26:54","endTime":"27:06","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So there's a lot of expertise.","startTime":"27:06","endTime":"27:08","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Digimarc also has a lot of IP in the watermarking space and generally a lot of experience in making things as imperceptible as it can be and making these watermarks as strong as they can be.","startTime":"27:09","endTime":"27:23","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Now, a watermark is also not bomb proof.","startTime":"27:23","endTime":"27:25","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You can remove it.","startTime":"27:25","endTime":"27:26","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Given enough time and compute power, you can remove a watermark from an image.","startTime":"27:27","endTime":"27:31","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But that's very different from stripping off the manifest, which is trivial and again done by almost all the tools out there already.","startTime":"27:31","endTime":"27:41","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"27:42","endTime":"27:42","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So it's already a step change in the, in the advantage.","startTime":"27:42","endTime":"27:45","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So walk me through, I guess, how if I crop an image, for instance, if I crop like 25% of an image, I kick off 75% of an image.","startTime":"27:46","endTime":"27:57","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What, what is the minimum ratio, I guess, or minimum size of an image do you need in order to recover that watermark?","startTime":"27:57","endTime":"28:04","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Recover the manifest for that watermark?","startTime":"28:05","endTime":"28:07","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What's the, like how, what's the fault tolerance?","startTime":"28:07","endTime":"28:09","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I guess for this.","startTime":"28:09","endTime":"28:11","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, that is a very hard question to answer in absolute terms.","startTime":"28:12","endTime":"28:17","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What I'll say though is that the watermarks, the digimarc watermarks are implemented with a lot of redundancy and so even a, you know, a fraction of the image will, might still contain the full payload.","startTime":"28:18","endTime":"28:32","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So there's a lot of redundancy in watermarking.","startTime":"28:32","endTime":"28:36","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Answering that question in absolute terms is very hard because it really depends on the image, the type of media, the colors that you have, and so on.","startTime":"28:36","endTime":"28:45","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But generally it's resilient to this type of attacks to a certain level.","startTime":"28:46","endTime":"28:53","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I think one important point is that the idea of introducing watermarking into C2PA is primarily first and foremost to resolve the non malicious issues.","startTime":"28:53","endTime":"29:07","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Resolving the malicious issues is almost like a cherry on top Right.","startTime":"29:08","endTime":"29:13","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because right now the thing that really for me we can see 2 pa is all the non malicious issues, basically.","startTime":"29:13","endTime":"29:20","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"29:20","endTime":"29:20","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You create your image with a Leica

Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You have a signature, it's digitally signed by Victor, it's all good.","startTime":"29:23","endTime":"29:26","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Then you upload it pretty much anywhere and the manifest is gone.","startTime":"29:27","endTime":"29:31","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"29:31","endTime":"29:31","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so that's really, I think, the primary issue that has to be solved and where watermarks can help.","startTime":"29:31","endTime":"29:38","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"29:39","endTime":"29:39","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And that's, I mean, particularly going back into the, I guess, hoppiest journalism that happens.","startTime":"29:39","endTime":"29:44","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"A lot of people take a photo on their cell phone and that being shared on social media and picked up by news outlets and sourced as a credential evidence of something happened.","startTime":"29:44","endTime":"29:54","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"29:54","endTime":"29:54","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"In reality that might not at all be a real event.","startTime":"29:54","endTime":"29:58","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I guess, yeah.","startTime":"29:58","endTime":"29:59","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Particular the problematic element of these social media platforms, stripping that metadata is obviously for good reasons to be fair, but is obviously kind of undermining the whole narrative around C2PA, if that is one of the use cases.","startTime":"29:59","endTime":"30:14","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right, yeah.","startTime":"30:14","endTime":"30:15","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I have to say here, to be totally fair to the C2PA standard, that there are discussions with the social media platforms to ensure that they don't strip off CP simply all the manifests and all the headers of assets, but that they selectively do so.","startTime":"30:15","endTime":"30:31","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so they would keep potentially in the future they would keep the C2Pmanifest or at least the part that's not an issue from a privacy standpoint.","startTime":"30:32","endTime":"30:44","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But yeah, it's a long road also with different kind of incentives to do so depending on who you are.","startTime":"30:44","endTime":"30:52","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And the social media platforms don't necessarily are not necessarily ones benefiting the most from pushing this type of technology.","startTime":"30:52","endTime":"31:01","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I think that's where really the watermark can help bridging until we get there, if we ever get there, to be honest.","startTime":"31:01","endTime":"31:10","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What's the roadmap like for getting watermarking into the C2PA standard and more commonly adopted in.","startTime":"31:10","endTime":"31:19","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I guess you still have some proof.","startTime":"31:19","endTime":"31:20","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Already got some proof concept as I presume.","startTime":"31:20","endTime":"31:22","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But in terms of getting that into the lightcast of the world to get them to implement the watermarking, because I assume they're a lot more computationally heavy to do on a camera as well.","startTime":"31:22","endTime":"31:31","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yes and no.","startTime":"31:33","endTime":"31:34","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And this is also where digimark has a lot of experience in the embedded side of watermarking.","startTime":"31:34","endTime":"31:42","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We've been embedded in many devices, billions of devices already.","startTime":"31:42","endTime":"31:47","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so it, you know, we have expertise, others as well.","startTime":"31:47","endTime":"31:51","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"31:51","endTime":"31:52","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But that's one of the core advantages.","startTime":"31:52","endTime":"31:54","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it's not necessarily a footprint Problem.","startTime":"31:54","endTime":"31:57","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's not necessarily going to be really the issue, but I think first of all, we need the watermarking standard to be part of the CTP standard.","startTime":"31:57","endTime":"32:08","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And basically, as it says on this slide, there was a task force created in September 2023 that I actually co chair together with someone from Adobe.","startTime":"32:08","endTime":"32:19","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And the idea is really, it's very early stage right now, but the idea is really to gather the use cases, understand what the industry wants from the watermark, and then start to make small modifications to the C2P standard so that it really embraces watermark as a soft binding technique with clear ways of binding the image and the watermark together.","startTime":"32:19","endTime":"32:42","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it's work in progress.","startTime":"32:43","endTime":"32:45","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It has started, work in progressing well.","startTime":"32:45","endTime":"32:48","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Any and anyone wanting to join you can actually join C2PA and help us.","startTime":"32:48","endTime":"32:52","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's a really open consortium, so joining it is pretty easy for anyone, any company.","startTime":"32:53","endTime":"32:59","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Cool.","startTime":"33:00","endTime":"33:00","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"All right, let's dive into the sighting process because I think that's really interesting to me and that really starts with an identity.","startTime":"33:00","endTime":"33:07","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And you said in the case of Leica cameras, it's some kind of cryptographic key that generated on the device, I presume you can export that key and is that the X509 key or what?","startTime":"33:08","endTime":"33:18","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Actually, behind the scenes, what's the cryptographic standard?","startTime":"33:18","endTime":"33:23","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I guess behind this?","startTime":"33:23","endTime":"33:24","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, so today it's really SSL like and this is where I think the standard is also going to evolve to embrace a lot more verifiable credentials and technique.","startTime":"33:25","endTime":"33:39","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But today basically, Leica acts.","startTime":"33:39","endTime":"33:43","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"In the case of Leica Camera, Leica would act as a certification authority and their certificate would then generate a certificate for you or a key for you and then you sign that.","startTime":"33:43","endTime":"33:58","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And yeah, the same.","startTime":"34:00","endTime":"34:01","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If you use Photoshop today and you enable content credentials, then you'll have an Adobe generated certificate.","startTime":"34:01","endTime":"34:08","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So the trust authority is going to be Adobe and then they are signing for you.","startTime":"34:08","endTime":"34:13","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you have a certificate that's generated for you.","startTime":"34:13","endTime":"34:16","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So here you have a very interesting attack vector, right.","startTime":"34:16","endTime":"34:19","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So if you can export the private key from your Leica camera in an attack, you can essentially impersonate that person and kind of exploit the CTPA program.","startTime":"34:19","endTime":"34:31","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So if I can get a camera, if I can export one of the cameras from say a BBC photojournalist, I could impersonate that person with an AI generated image and BBC would be non devisor.","startTime":"34:31","endTime":"34:43","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"How is the threat modeling around that?","startTime":"34:44","endTime":"34:45","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Have you had any conversation with camera vendors like is it TPM based or can you export the key or some kind of Trusted platform.","startTime":"34:45","endTime":"34:53","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, I mean I don't have all the details, but obviously these keys are stored in a safe place and they have crypto chips in the camera that store these keys.","startTime":"34:54","endTime":"35:05","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so yeah, I'm not too worried about that in the sense that it's a general problem.","startTime":"35:06","endTime":"35:11","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's not dissimilar to what you have with crypto wallets and hardware wallets and so on.","startTime":"35:11","endTime":"35:17","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I think that's not necessarily an issue.","startTime":"35:18","endTime":"35:22","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think what's more an issue is the trust model above and beyond the key.","startTime":"35:23","endTime":"35:28","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because if you Google a bit and look at C2PA attacks, you can see that actually you could also create your own certificate and say you are, say you're the BBC and create an alternative BBC certificate and start signing things as the BBC.","startTime":"35:28","endTime":"35:45","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"As long as there is not a set of trusted routes.","startTime":"35:45","endTime":"35:51","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's a little bit the wide West.","startTime":"35:52","endTime":"35:54","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"35:54","endTime":"35:55","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So there is no equivalent to the root of trust that

sense.","startTime":"36:01","endTime":"36:02","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, your browser has a set of root certificates that it trusts.","startTime":"36:02","endTime":"36:07","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We need to get to a similar construct for C2PA.","startTime":"36:07","endTime":"36:12","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"36:12","endTime":"36:13","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And that kind of makes me think a lot about PGP in the early days.","startTime":"36:13","endTime":"36:17","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Well, still PDP still a thing of course and it's still use it once in a while but because there you have a decentralized and I guess predating the whole web three by a good 20 years of trust.","startTime":"36:17","endTime":"36:29","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"36:29","endTime":"36:30","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"With signing parties and whatnot.","startTime":"36:30","endTime":"36:31","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But that's obviously not scalable for a commercial model, which is why you have these.","startTime":"36:31","endTime":"36:35","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But so you're thinking that it would be more mimicking the regular CAT structures then.","startTime":"36:35","endTime":"36:48","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And will be the same actually.","startTime":"36:48","endTime":"36:50","speaker_name":"Viktor

certificates?","startTime":"36:50","endTime":"36:56","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because BBC already, obviously they already have their own certificates of course,

Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"37:02","endTime":"37:03","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Is that something that you think would be merged into that or is it more taking the path down blockchain?","startTime":"37:04","endTime":"37:10","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Well, I think it's going to be a mix of both.","startTime":"37:12","endTime":"37:14","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"37:14","endTime":"37:14","speaker_name":"Dom

one, Adobe have one.","startTime":"37:21","endTime":"37:24","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So why don't we use that?","startTime":"37:24","endTime":"37:26","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think where it gets interesting is to start leveraging Web3 and dids and verifiable credentials to also allow not only big entities to sign, but also individuals to sign.","startTime":"37:26","endTime":"37:40","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I think the two worlds will get closer and closer to one another.","startTime":"37:41","endTime":"37:47","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think what's Also interesting in the crypto world is when you sign up for, let's say, a crypto exchange account, then you have a proper KYC that's put in place.","startTime":"37:47","endTime":"37:59","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we know that this key belongs to Victor and we have verified who Victor is.","startTime":"37:59","endTime":"38:03","speaker_name":"Dom

some extent.","startTime":"40:55","endTime":"41:08","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because my understanding is they have multiple signing

couple of things.","startTime":"43:31","endTime":"43:33","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We have basically launched this content credential extension that you can now download from the Chrome Store.","startTime":"43:37","endTime":"43:46","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And the idea was just when we started playing with C2PA, we felt like there was a lack of a independent way of verifying and displaying the C2PA manifest of the content credentials.","startTime":"43:46","endTime":"44:02","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because if you go on a site.","startTime":"44:02","endTime":"44:05","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Let me just turn this off.","startTime":"44:05","endTime":"44:06","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But if you go on.","startTime":"44:06","endTime":"44:08","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Trupik is one of the big actors also behind the C2PA standard, and you go on their site, you have great examples of C2PA manifest right here on the images.","startTime":"44:10","endTime":"44:22","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Now, the problem I have with that is that the way it works currently is that they basically embed the JavaScript verification library themselves.","startTime":"44:22","endTime":"44:32","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So if you actually are a malicious actor, then it becomes pretty easy to fool your audience by simply, you know, faking it here.","startTime":"44:32","endTime":"44:44","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right, because you embed it.","startTime":"44:44","endTime":"44:46","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we felt that was a limitation.","startTime":"44:46","endTime":"44:50","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And also that generally the idea of every site must embed the whole C2PA verification and displaying functionality didn't really make sense.","startTime":"44:50","endTime":"45:01","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I mean, it's a bootstrap, right?","startTime":"45:01","endTime":"45:02","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Everyone knows that's the way to get started.","startTime":"45:02","endTime":"45:04","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But that's why we thought, hey, there's a need for making your browser the one that verifies and displays content credentials.","startTime":"45:05","endTime":"45:14","speaker_name":"Dom

turn it on and I go, say on the Digimarc blog, and I take, for instance, this blog post, then I'll see that I start to have little CR icons appearing on the images.","startTime":"45:17","endTime":"45:39","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that's basically what the plugin does.","startTime":"45:39","endTime":"45:41","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The plugin basically looks for images that you're looking at and then checks if they have a manifest.","startTime":"45:41","endTime":"45:47","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If they have no manifest, it does nothing.","startTime":"45:47","endTime":"45:49","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But if they have a manifest, it verifies it.","startTime":"45:49","endTime":"45:52","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it verifies all the signatures using the process that's described in the standard, and then it displays it.","startTime":"45:52","endTime":"45:59","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right, so you can see the producer there.","startTime":"45:59","endTime":"46:01","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So how would these.","startTime":"46:01","endTime":"46:02","speaker_name":"Viktor

think?","startTime":"46:06","endTime":"46:07","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean, one of them is generated by AI, the other one

similar.","startTime":"46:47","endTime":"46:49","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But, yeah, and so you can see directly the tool here helps you distinguish what was generated

then, right?","startTime":"46:59","endTime":"47:01","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, in this case, it was signed by digimarc.","startTime":"47:01","endTime":"47:04","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And you can also have an independent audit of the

the tool allows you to do.","startTime":"47:23","endTime":"47:26","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay, so let's.","startTime":"47:26","endTime":"47:28","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"47:28","endTime":"47:28","speaker_name":"Viktor

private.","startTime":"50:03","endTime":"50:04","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"All right, so digimarch digimark signs it, but in the signature, it points to the fact that it

gonna.","startTime":"50:33","endTime":"50:36","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The tool is gonna add a manifest, but it's also then gonna generate a.","startTime":"50:36","endTime":"50:40","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"A watermark and add the watermark to the image and then tie the

verifiable credential that I'm signing with my key here.","startTime":"50:48","endTime":"50:57","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So metamask popped up and now I can sign it, and it's adding the watermark to the image.","startTime":"50:57","endTime":"51:03","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then I'll be able to show you that the image now contains a.","startTime":"51:07","endTime":"51:11","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I can download the image and it now contains a manifest.","startTime":"51:12","endTime":"51:16","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And visually, it obviously, because it's XIM data, it is not visible to the eye.","startTime":"51:17","endTime":"51:23","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, well, yeah, so it contains now an EXIF manifest where you have the C2PA content

do.","startTime":"51:52","endTime":"51:53","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Can use the CTP toolchain to basically get the manifest that's attached to this image, and that's a

big.","startTime":"53:07","endTime":"53:09","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like if there are lots of modifications of the

right.","startTime":"53:38","endTime":"53:39","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But it could be like a percent off the image size in metadata or few

again, I don't even need to be an attacker, Right.","startTime":"54:17","endTime":"54:20","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I could basically upload this image to Twitter, to X or Facebook and it would remove the manifest.","startTime":"54:20","endTime":"54:26","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But here, just for the sake of example, I just took an online tool, right?","startTime":"54:27","endTime":"54:33","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And now I have this other image.","startTime":"54:33","endTime":"54:35","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So if I go here and now I look at the tool on that new image, then it tells me There are no

EXIF data.","startTime":"54:59","endTime":"55:05","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, yeah, that's a good point actually.","startTime":"55:06","endTime":"55:09","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"55:09","endTime":"55:10","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"55:11","endTime":"55:12","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And here it gets spotted.","startTime":"55:12","endTime":"55:13","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"55:13","endTime":"55:14","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So this is basically the crux of the strength of watermarks that the strengths watermarks add to.","startTime":"55:14","endTime":"55:21","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So this image did have a watermark as part of it.","startTime":"55:22","endTime":"55:25","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It is not just EXIF data.","startTime":"55:25","endTime":"55:27","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, yeah, exactly.","startTime":"55:27","endTime":"55:28","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We watermarked it when we did the protect step, we basically watermarked it.","startTime":"55:28","endTime":"55:33","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We created the manifest and watermarked it through digimarc validates watermarks.","startTime":"55:33","endTime":"55:39","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"55:40","endTime":"55:41","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And if you had only used the non watermark approach, I guess you would not.","startTime":"55:42","endTime":"55:48","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Would have you be able to restore it the same way?","startTime":"55:48","endTime":"55:50","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"No.","startTime":"55:51","endTime":"55:51","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Basically, if I don't watermark it and I verify, then it's going to tell me it knows nothing about this image.","startTime":"55:51","endTime":"55:59","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So even if you haven't altered it based on the hash, that it would not have been able to look it up reverse.","startTime":"55:59","endTime":"56:06","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Look that up on the image without the watermark with only.","startTime":"56:06","endTime":"56:10","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Well, no.","startTime":"56:10","endTime":"56:11","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If you had a soft binding, like a perceptual hash, and then you were querying the right repository, then it would tell you, potentially if you made no modification, then the soft binding should work.","startTime":"56:11","endTime":"56:24","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If you made no modification, even a hard binding would work like an actual hash.","startTime":"56:24","endTime":"56:30","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But there's a problem with that, which is who do you ask?","startTime":"56:30","endTime":"56:34","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"56:34","endTime":"56:35","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because the idea is that, yeah, not all images will be in a central place.","startTime":"56:35","endTime":"56:40","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"56:40","endTime":"56:40","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And not all manifests will be centralized.","startTime":"56:41","endTime":"56:44","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So without the watermark, there's a real problem of knowing which repository do you ask for manifests when you don't have a manifest?","startTime":"56:44","endTime":"56:53","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Of course.","startTime":"56:53","endTime":"56:54","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And with the Chrome extension, if you were to say, browse a website that has this image with the EXIF data stripped, would it be able to say, actually this should be attributed to this person?","startTime":"56:54","endTime":"57:13","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I mean, essentially you would be ddosing, essentially digimarc servers as you were browsing the Internet, I guess.","startTime":"57:13","endTime":"57:20","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But I'm curious if that would be like a reverse lookup.","startTime":"57:20","endTime":"57:23","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you could say, actually this is stolen from there.","startTime":"57:23","endTime":"57:26","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Or in the case of stock image.","startTime":"57:26","endTime":"57:28","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, well, I'd say if you don't have a watermark, you'll be DDOSing the manifest repository.","startTime":"57:28","endTime":"57:33","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But if you don't have a watermark, in theory, not.","startTime":"57:33","endTime":"57:36","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"57:36","endTime":"57:36","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because you will only check when you see the watermark.","startTime":"57:36","endTime":"57:41","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So as watermarks become widespread, that's a clear signal of, well, this image had a manifest and here's the watermark vendor, so you should go and query their repository.","startTime":"57:41","endTime":"57:54","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"No, I meant more in the case.","startTime":"57:54","endTime":"57:56","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Let's say you upload this image to Twitter strips the EXIF data.","startTime":"57:56","endTime":"58:01","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We would not pick up that it is a verified image.","startTime":"58:02","endTime":"58:07","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"58:07","endTime":"58:07","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because that would be an interesting feature to have for, say, Twitter, where you actually can traverse back and say this is actually the real image.","startTime":"58:08","endTime":"58:15","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"58:16","endTime":"58:17","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So this, in theory, the extension could do that.","startTime":"58:17","endTime":"58:22","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"58:22","endTime":"58:22","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean, we created the extension to be 100% standard compliant.","startTime":"58:22","endTime":"58:26","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So currently it doesn't include a watermark because it's not yet part of the standard.","startTime":"58:26","endTime":"58:32","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But the next version of the extension, we will basically look for watermarks, look for Digital validate watermarks.","startTime":"58:32","endTime":"58:39","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And we will then reconcile the watermark with the manifest on the fly.","startTime":"58:40","endTime":"58:48","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"When there is a watermark.","startTime":"58:48","endTime":"58:50","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"58:50","endTime":"58:50","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we could start doing what you said, right.","startTime":"58:51","endTime":"58:53","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like if there's no manifest but the watermark is still there, we could tell you.","startTime":"58:53","endTime":"58:56","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Well, we could tell you something similar to what's here.","startTime":"58:56","endTime":"59:00","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"59:00","endTime":"59:01","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That was your original image.","startTime":"59:01","endTime":"59:02","speaker_name":"Dom

uploaded.","startTime":"59:03","endTime":"59:04","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But we have this image that the watermark point us pointed us to with this manifest.","startTime":"59:04","endTime":"59:11","speaker_name":"Dom Guinard","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, exactly.","startTime":"59:12","endTime":"59:13","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And.","startTime":"59:13","endTime":"59:14","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"All right, so we're getting to the kind of like our scheduled time for the show.","startTime":"59:14","endTime":"59:19","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So let's start.","startTime":"59:19","endTime":"59:20","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I would love to start wrapping things here and move forward to kind of like, where are the next steps?","startTime":"59:20","endTime":"59:25","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Where can people learn more?","startTime":"59:25","endTime":"59:26","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And it's been super interesting to myself as well.","startTime":"59:26","endTime":"59:29","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I'm just curious, where can we learn more about this stuff?","startTime":"59:29","endTime":"59:32","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"How?","startTime":"59:32","endTime":"59:32","speaker_name":"Viktor
