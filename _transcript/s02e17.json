definitely.","startTime":"05:38","endTime":"05:39","speaker_name":"Sean Rhodes","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think it depends on where you sort of where you're viewing as getting it

that's.","startTime":"06:33","endTime":"06:34","speaker_name":"Sean Rhodes","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That's all working nicely now.","startTime":"06:34","endTime":"06:35","speaker_name":"Sean

general.","startTime":"07:08","endTime":"07:10","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And just like they bypass that entire step.","startTime":"07:10","endTime":"07:12","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like what is your view on like how that adoption is going to drive beyond like the extreme edge case that is I guess Oxide.","startTime":"07:12","endTime":"07:20","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think it will stay as an edge

drawbacks.","startTime":"07:37","endTime":"07:40","speaker_name":"Sean Rhodes","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You know, Windows, forget about it, which is still a chunk of our user base who dual boot or have to use it every now and then.","startTime":"07:40","endTime":"07:47","speaker_name":"Sean Rhodes","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You know, dual booting, updating is just a nightmare and then you get incompatibilities with firmware matching and things like that.","startTime":"07:48","endTime":"07:55","speaker_name":"Sean Rhodes","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So it's really cool as something you can do.","startTime":"07:55","endTime":"08:00","speaker_name":"Sean Rhodes","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But I don't think it's ever gonna evolve out of, you know, someone building for themselves

was.","startTime":"08:08","endTime":"08:10","speaker_name":"Sean Rhodes","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But yeah, I mean I guess the Chromebook is a good example of something like that.","startTime":"08:10","endTime":"08:14","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's a tailor built machine that is building a tailored os, I mean Chrome

products.","startTime":"08:52","endTime":"08:54","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Obviously we showed the byte

building it and I think the issue you hit first with building hardware is the tooling costs being so high, you know, compared to you know, Apple and Dell when you know they've got £300,000, you know, to play in tooling but then they're splitting it over, you know, hundreds of thousands of models and when we're in a niche already and then we keep partnering into a niche because that's what people

our stuff, you know, when we're first doing it, you'll chuck this on it just so you can actually check, you know, things are working and efficiency is

of anyone else, I haven't really.","startTime":"33:13","endTime":"33:15","speaker_name":"Sean Rhodes","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We don't really run into them, so to

and a bunch of engineers and then I think most of the others primarily work on downstream forks.","startTime":"33:29","endTime":"33:43","speaker_name":"Sean Rhodes","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So there isn't that much crossover.","startTime":"33:43","endTime":"33:45","speaker_name":"Sean Rhodes","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, it just doesn't really come

what.","startTime":"34:01","endTime":"34:01","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean, do you see a world where it will become more mainstream, where it becomes a viable

guys.","startTime":"34:14","endTime":"34:15","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"How do you see the maturity of that?","startTime":"34:16","endTime":"34:17","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I don't think it would be corrupt because coreboot is quite stuck in its ways.","startTime":"34:18","endTime":"34:23","speaker_name":"Sean Rhodes","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Not in a bad way, but stuck in its ways for sort of, you know, mainstream vendors to pick it up and it become approachable.","startTime":"34:23","endTime":"34:29","speaker_name":"Sean Rhodes","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think an open source alternative is possible because AMI dropped their open source one, I think it was a couple of years ago.","startTime":"34:29","endTime":"34:37","speaker_name":"Sean Rhodes","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That was a very streamlined EVK2 base.","startTime":"34:37","endTime":"34:40","speaker_name":"Sean Rhodes","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I bought that.","startTime":"34:41","endTime":"34:42","speaker_name":"Sean Rhodes","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Or slim bootloader, I guess.","startTime":"34:42","endTime":"34:43","speaker_name":"Sean Rhodes","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But I think those could appeal to,

management.","startTime":"34:43","endTime":"34:53","speaker_name":"Sean Rhodes","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But they're not going to be completely learning how to do things again because yeah, I mean going from AMI to core boot they are entirely different.","startTime":"34:53","endTime":"35:03","speaker_name":"Sean Rhodes","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Whereas AMI to slim bootloader is still really K2.","startTime":"35:04","endTime":"35:08","speaker_name":"Sean Rhodes","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So it's pretty much the same thing.","startTime":"35:08","endTime":"35:09","speaker_name":"Sean Rhodes","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, so that's where you would you think, do you see the future of CoreBook more being in custom tailored embedded vendors like yourself?","startTime":"35:10","endTime":"35:20","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Is that purely plus?","startTime":"35:20","endTime":"35:22","speaker_name":"Viktor

a fork of it.","startTime":"35:44","endTime":"35:47","speaker_name":"Sean Rhodes","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's popped up.","startTime":"35:47","endTime":"35:48","speaker_name":"Sean Rhodes","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But I think that sort of implementation I guess could grow because I mean if you think if you want a lightweight fast bootloader with no junk in it, cool boot is, it's the dream.","startTime":"35:48","endTime":"35:58","speaker_name":"Sean Rhodes","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yes.","startTime":"35:59","endTime":"35:59","speaker_name":"Viktor

see.","startTime":"36:02","endTime":"36:03","speaker_name":"Sean Rhodes","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Oh yeah, that, that, yeah that doesn't surprise me because I, I know there are people in the

all.","startTime":"36:12","endTime":"36:14","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Interesting.","startTime":"36:16","endTime":"36:16","speaker_name":"Viktor

it.","startTime":"37:44","endTime":"37:49","speaker_name":"Sean Rhodes","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And theory is people buy these, stick their logo on it, you know, choose option lists, buying a new

on the boards and patch them and like.","startTime":"38:09","endTime":"38:13","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Or do you have the ability like patch on bias on that, put your own bias on there or the.","startTime":"38:13","endTime":"38:19","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Way it was back then is that you did maintain their own internal

hiccups I think, which will probably smooth over in the next six months, a year, hopefully it's back to working everywhere.","startTime":"40:17","endTime":"40:24","speaker_name":"Sean
