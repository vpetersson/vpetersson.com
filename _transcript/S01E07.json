ish.","startTime":"01:18","endTime":"01:21","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So I've been involved for a long time.","startTime":"01:22","endTime":"01:24","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I was a high schooler at the time, didn't know anything about coding, didn't know anything about bios, but I like to build my own computers from scratch.","startTime":"01:26","endTime":"01:33","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I was a gamer and overclocker, and at the time Los Alamos National Lab, which is a high performance computing lab, needed cheap labor to build servers using off the shelf components.","startTime":"01:33","endTime":"01:45","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So my job there was basically to purchase processors and RAM from sites like Newegg, just off the shelf stuff, put them together, throw them in a rack, and then the rest of the team would put the clustering software like Beowulf on it.","startTime":"01:45","endTime":"02:00","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And of course we'd run coreboot and show that you could actually build very good high performance computing systems out of cheap parts.","startTime":"02:00","endTime":"02:08","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Flash forward, I managed to land a job at Google.","startTime":"02:08","endTime":"02:11","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"A couple years into that, I found my way into the Chrome

laptops.","startTime":"02:15","endTime":"02:18","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And so I was the first firmware engineer on the Chrome OS team.","startTime":"02:18","endTime":"02:22","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Stayed there for about seven or eight years, then went off to other companies to try and find my roots back in servers again and get open source firmware pushed on servers.","startTime":"02:22","endTime":"02:32","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So that brought me to my current place and my previous employer.","startTime":"02:32","endTime":"02:38","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So that's about it for me.","startTime":"02:38","endTime":"02:40","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Matt, of course is Mr.","startTime":"02:40","endTime":"02:41","speaker_name":"David

Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Well, my background's very similar to David's.","startTime":"02:46","endTime":"02:49","speaker_name":"Matt Devillier","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I grew up being a hardware tinkerer, building my own computers, overclocking, playing games, things like that, the Doomquake, the early days.","startTime":"02:49","endTime":"03:00","speaker_name":"Matt Devillier","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And out of college got a job just doing coding day to day and didn't really code too much as a hobby.","startTime":"03:00","endTime":"03:10","speaker_name":"Matt Devillier","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I also was into home theater at the time and building custom media centers for people using XBMC, which is now Kodi.","startTime":"03:10","endTime":"03:21","speaker_name":"Matt Devillier","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so around early 2010s when the first Chrome OS devices came out, the first Chromebox or actually the second generation Chromebox was a really excellent candidate for a media center.","startTime":"03:22","endTime":"03:36","speaker_name":"Matt Devillier","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so I bought one of those with the intention of hacking it and turning it into a custom media center that I could resell to my customers.","startTime":"03:36","endTime":"03:44","speaker_name":"Matt Devillier","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I didn't know anything about firmware at the time, but you know, there was somebody else online who offered firmware that you could download in Flash and the guy didn't support the new Chromebox, but he built something for me and gave it to me to Flash and it bricked the box.","startTime":"03:44","endTime":"04:01","speaker_name":"Matt Devillier","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And he's kind of like, well, you know, I don't know a whole lot about these devices.","startTime":"04:01","endTime":"04:04","speaker_name":"Matt Devillier","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I just know how to compile and distribute them and support, you know, the one or two devices that he had.","startTime":"04:04","endTime":"04:10","speaker_name":"Matt Devillier","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so I was kind of left to my own devices to figure out, you know, what went wrong, how to unbrick it.","startTime":"04:10","endTime":"04:16","speaker_name":"Matt Devillier","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I had to go out and order a bus pirate to be able to reflash the firmware.","startTime":"04:16","endTime":"04:21","speaker_name":"Matt Devillier","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And the Corebook community on IRC was extremely welcoming and helpful, especially a lot of the Google engineers who frequented it at the time.","startTime":"04:21","endTime":"04:32","speaker_name":"Matt Devillier","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so I just started playing around with that as a hobby and eventually got the box working, made some improvements, submitted some patches, and essentially distributed my work for other people who are looking to do the same thing, use the Chromebox as a media center.","startTime":"04:33","endTime":"04:53","speaker_name":"Matt Devillier","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And you know, as time went by I just added support for more and more devices.","startTime":"04:54","endTime":"05:01","speaker_name":"Matt Devillier","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You know, there were some other community members who kind of supported some Chromebooks and eventually I just absorbed their work.","startTime":"05:01","endTime":"05:09","speaker_name":"Matt Devillier","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And you know, as of today I now support every intel based Chrome OS device since 2012.","startTime":"05:09","endTime":"05:18","speaker_name":"Matt Devillier","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So a good decade plus worth of devices, it's 250 and counting.","startTime":"05:19","endTime":"05:24","speaker_name":"Matt Devillier","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Wow.","startTime":"05:24","endTime":"05:25","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Any estimate on how many people use the Mr.","startTime":"05:26","endTime":"05:28","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Chromebox version?","startTime":"05:28","endTime":"05:30","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You know, I used to track downloads, but I don't anymore.","startTime":"05:33","endTime":"05:36","speaker_name":"Matt Devillier","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You know, it was over it was a couple hundred thousand, last I checked, as well as some commercial companies that use it for repurposing chromevox for their own digital signage purposes and things like that.","startTime":"05:37","endTime":"05:52","speaker_name":"Matt Devillier","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I know one company that I did some custom work for that has, you know, 50,000 devices out there just alone.","startTime":"05:52","endTime":"06:00","speaker_name":"Matt Devillier","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So, yeah, it's substantial.","startTime":"06:01","endTime":"06:04","speaker_name":"Matt Devillier","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"06:06","endTime":"06:07","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"One of the interesting places that Chrome OS and by extension coreboot have found themselves is in things like kiosks, point of sales devices, digital signage.","startTime":"06:07","endTime":"06:18","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"That was actually one of the last projects I worked on at Google because, you know, it boots very quickly.","startTime":"06:18","endTime":"06:24","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You know, sometimes you might walk around or you might be driving around and you see a sign that's, you know, it's like Pixie booting or it's at the blue screen of death or something like that.","startTime":"06:25","endTime":"06:33","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And, you know, advertisers hate that because they're not making money on that billboard space.","startTime":"06:33","endTime":"06:38","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So, you know, little Chrome boxes and coreboot fit really well.","startTime":"06:38","endTime":"06:43","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Something that's very simple, very fast.","startTime":"06:43","endTime":"06:45","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"If, for whatever reason, the hardware goes down, it comes back up and you can be up and running again in a couple of seconds.","startTime":"06:45","endTime":"06:51","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Absolutely.","startTime":"06:53","endTime":"06:53","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I mean, we've been working with Signage for the last decade, and definitely it becomes a bit of a confirmation bias when you see all these broken screens around the world.","startTime":"06:53","endTime":"07:04","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"07:04","endTime":"07:04","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So absolutely, I can relate to that.","startTime":"07:05","endTime":"07:07","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Cool.","startTime":"07:07","endTime":"07:08","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Let's dive into coreboot.","startTime":"07:09","endTime":"07:11","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So.","startTime":"07:11","endTime":"07:11","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So let's start with a perhaps silly question, but why does it matter?","startTime":"07:11","endTime":"07:17","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Why does coreboot exist and why does it matter?","startTime":"07:18","endTime":"07:21","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I guess I'll start because I was around towards the beginning, and then Matt can probably fill in details from later on.","startTime":"07:23","endTime":"07:30","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So at first, as I said, actually, this is, I think, the project's 25th anniversary.","startTime":"07:30","endTime":"07:36","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Oh, wow.","startTime":"07:36","endTime":"07:37","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"07:37","endTime":"07:37","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yes.","startTime":"07:37","endTime":"07:38","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It's been around since, you know, the very late 90s, essentially.","startTime":"07:38","endTime":"07:41","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And of course, back then, if you wanted x86 BIOS was.","startTime":"07:41","endTime":"07:45","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It was just legacy BIOS all around.","startTime":"07:46","endTime":"07:48","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Even UEFI didn't really take off until the late 2000s.","startTime":"07:49","endTime":"07:53","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And so for.","startTime":"07:53","endTime":"07:56","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So.","startTime":"07:56","endTime":"07:57","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So the story at Los Alamos National Lab was they were.","startTime":"07:57","endTime":"08:01","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"They were trying to bring up one of these clusters built with cheap x86 components.","startTime":"08:01","endTime":"08:05","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"They had, I don't know, like 1200 nodes or something, usually a power of two.","startTime":"08:06","endTime":"08:11","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So like 10, 28 nodes, 2048 nodes.","startTime":"08:11","endTime":"08:14","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"They rolled the racks into the data center, they powered them on, and each and every one came up with a prompt that said, no keyboard found.","startTime":"08:14","endTime":"08:24","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Hit F1 to continue.","startTime":"08:24","endTime":"08:25","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So the way they had to solve that at the time is you give a team of about a dozen PhD computer scientists and physicists, keyboards, and they fan out and go out to all the aisles, plug them in, hit F1 to continue.","startTime":"08:26","endTime":"08:40","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Problem is, the high performance computing software at the time was not very resilient to failure.","startTime":"08:41","endTime":"08:46","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And so oftentimes if one node had a problem, you know, like maybe a, you know, a hard drive crashed, you know, they didn't have NVMEs or SSDs at the time.","startTime":"08:46","endTime":"08:55","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So these were a big point of failure.","startTime":"08:55","endTime":"08:57","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You know, you'd reboot one node and you'd have to restart the whole cluster and then go through that process again, send a bunch of PhDs out to the aisles to plug in keyboards and do whatever.","startTime":"08:58","endTime":"09:07","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So Ron was basically like, you know, screw this.","startTime":"09:08","endTime":"09:11","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And he thought, hey, you know, what if we just put Linux in that Flash chip?","startTime":"09:11","endTime":"09:18","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Linux, you know, even at the time it, you know, it was pretty smart.","startTime":"09:18","endTime":"09:21","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It could do a lot of PCIe initialization, did a lot of hardware initialization.","startTime":"09:21","endTime":"09:25","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So the very first version of coreboot was basically a function that would, it would set up the C runtime environment and then just basically try to jump straight to a Linux ELF image.","startTime":"09:25","endTime":"09:38","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And it did not work.","startTime":"09:39","endTime":"09:40","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It turns out initializing hardware is a little bit more complicated than turn it on, jump to Linux.","startTime":"09:40","endTime":"09:45","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But that's kind of the genesis of the project.","startTime":"09:45","endTime":"09:47","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"That's why it was originally called Linux BIOS up until I want to say around 2007 or 2008 was because the idea from the very get go was do the absolute minimum you need to do to get Linux booting.","startTime":"09:47","endTime":"10:00","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"The idea kind of took off and people started using it for other operating systems.","startTime":"10:01","endTime":"10:05","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You know, they even got Windows booting pretty, you know, maybe mid 2000s or so.","startTime":"10:05","endTime":"10:10","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And so the name Linux BIOS, you know, it wasn't necessarily Linux centric at the time and it wasn't a bios.","startTime":"10:10","endTime":"10:17","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So the name Linux BIOS didn't make sense, so they changed it to Core Boot.","startTime":"10:17","endTime":"10:20","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So that's how it started was kind of the inflexibility of fixing some of these intractable problems with the bios.","startTime":"10:21","endTime":"10:31","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And then later on people are like, hey, this is kind of cool.","startTime":"10:33","endTime":"10:36","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It's open source, we can hack on it, we can customize it.","startTime":"10:36","endTime":"10:39","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You don't have to pay tens of thousands of dollars in royalties or consulting fees just to get one little piece of hardware running.","startTime":"10:39","endTime":"10:48","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And then from there it kind of grew and it was really fast.","startTime":"10:49","endTime":"10:52","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"No legacy code.","startTime":"10:52","endTime":"10:54","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"One of the things that at Google, when I was showing coreboot off to the Chrome OS team, I was Showing it off on early Intel Atom boards and Viya Nano boards.","startTime":"10:54","endTime":"11:06","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Viya was another x86 CPU vendor.","startTime":"11:06","endTime":"11:09","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"These things could literally hand off, you know, boot up and hand off to Linux in, you know, within 250 to 500 milliseconds.","startTime":"11:09","endTime":"11:15","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Wow.","startTime":"11:15","endTime":"11:16","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So that impressed the team.","startTime":"11:16","endTime":"11:18","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And that's what got it to be, you know, on the plan of record for Chromebooks at the time when, you know, a typical Wintel Netbook would maybe take, you know, 10, 15, 20 seconds before it would actually, you know, even begin to start booting Windows, much less get you to a prompt where you could log in.","startTime":"11:18","endTime":"11:36","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So Google was very keen on getting people to, you know, getting people to the prompt, logged in and browsing the web as quickly as possible.","startTime":"11:37","endTime":"11:44","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And how did that transpire from the early version of the Chromebooks?","startTime":"11:45","endTime":"11:49","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Were they running on coreboot from the get go or how was that adopted internally?","startTime":"11:49","endTime":"11:54","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It actually took a couple of generations.","startTime":"11:55","endTime":"11:57","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"The first two generations used a proprietary UEFI distribution.","startTime":"11:57","endTime":"12:02","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And I'll give them credit.","startTime":"12:03","endTime":"12:05","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"The company that we worked with, actually, they were very responsive.","startTime":"12:05","endTime":"12:08","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Typically in the BIOS world, you know, companies have a bad reputation for not responding to emails or not fixing bugs for most of the time.","startTime":"12:09","endTime":"12:17","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But, you know, at the end of the day there, you know, the team, you know, they were pretty keen on open source.","startTime":"12:18","endTime":"12:25","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"They liked the idea of open source.","startTime":"12:25","endTime":"12:26","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Coreboot was still able to boot faster on the hardware that it worked on at the time.","startTime":"12:26","endTime":"12:30","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And we also wanted something that could be ported to other processors very easily, the proprietary bios.","startTime":"12:31","endTime":"12:38","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"At the time, it really only worked with Intel Nanos, I'm sorry, Intel Atoms.","startTime":"12:38","endTime":"12:45","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And basically if you wanted it to work on some other intel processor, you had to get another version of the code base.","startTime":"12:46","endTime":"12:51","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Or if you wanted to work on an AMD processor, you had to work it on yet to get another code base and forget about arm.","startTime":"12:51","endTime":"13:00","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So ARM was something that, you know, of course, Chromebooks being relatively cheap, inexpensive products from the get go, you know, were interested in evaluating arm and we didn't want to have to deal with a whole other code base, whole other set of bugs, whole other security model.","startTime":"13:00","endTime":"13:16","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So the portability of coreboot really helped out a lot.","startTime":"13:17","endTime":"13:21","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And, you know, we started on x86.","startTime":"13:21","endTime":"13:23","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Coreboot was good at x86.","startTime":"13:23","endTime":"13:24","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"U boot was there as well.","startTime":"13:25","endTime":"13:26","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It would at the time, it would have taken a lot longer to get intel support added to U boot than to have ARM support added to coreboot.","startTime":"13:28","endTime":"13:35","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But, you know, they're both fine code bases.","startTime":"13:35","endTime":"13:38","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah, walk me through the like.","startTime":"13:38","endTime":"13:40","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because obviously if you play with any embedded platform, you've surely come across coreboot and you've probably.","startTime":"13:40","endTime":"13:46","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Well, at least you come across U Boot and definitely, most likely coreboot.","startTime":"13:46","endTime":"13:50","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Talk to me a bit about the difference between the two.","startTime":"13:50","endTime":"13:52","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And like coreboot is.","startTime":"13:52","endTime":"13:54","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Well, U boot is a bootloader, not just necessarily a bias measure.","startTime":"13:55","endTime":"14:00","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like walk me through the difference between the two and how they fit together.","startTime":"14:00","endTime":"14:03","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Sure.","startTime":"14:06","endTime":"14:06","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So they're both open source firmware projects.","startTime":"14:08","endTime":"14:11","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And this is something Matt and I were talking about the other day is probably every year or so we see somebody come in with the idea, hey, why don't coreboot and U boot just merge together?","startTime":"14:11","endTime":"14:20","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"14:20","endTime":"14:21","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I think the main thing is that they're both good at what they were designed for.","startTime":"14:21","endTime":"14:30","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Coreboot originally ran on servers, not just Xeons like old x86 Xeons, but also DEC Alpha, digital equipment Corporation Alpha, if anyone remembers that, Blast for the Past and PowerPC.","startTime":"14:30","endTime":"14:46","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But they were servers and they were meant to have PCI and so a lot of the resource allocation, the device discovery was built around pci, whereas with YOU boot it was really targeted more at embedded platforms where it's extremely simple.","startTime":"14:46","endTime":"15:03","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You basically, you know, you're just directly peeking and poking at registers through known MMIO addresses for the most part.","startTime":"15:03","endTime":"15:12","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And coreboot brings along a fair bit of framework to deal with PCI architecture.","startTime":"15:12","endTime":"15:19","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"U boot is very condensed, it's very compact, and the U boot people liked it that way.","startTime":"15:19","endTime":"15:24","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I don't think they wanted to pollute U boot with any x86 isms at the time.","startTime":"15:24","endTime":"15:28","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Okay, so that's fair.","startTime":"15:29","endTime":"15:32","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah, let's let Matt jump in with a few words on this as well.","startTime":"15:32","endTime":"15:36","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah, I think that's probably one of the biggest differences that coreboot is designed to discover connected hardware at runtime and dynamically configure it.","startTime":"15:37","endTime":"15:47","speaker_name":"Matt Devillier","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And U boot assumes a fixed hardware configuration.","startTime":"15:47","endTime":"15:51","speaker_name":"Matt Devillier","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so when you have that, you can make a lot of assumptions and you can eliminate a lot of possible code paths and you know, it's essentially a simpler design model in a way.","startTime":"15:52","endTime":"16:04","speaker_name":"Matt Devillier","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I guess the other main difference between coreboot and U Boot is designed to both initialize the hardware and be the bootloader, whereas coreboot is only designed to do hardware initialization and then to hand off to a second stage firmware payload which does the actual bootloading.","startTime":"16:05","endTime":"16:24","speaker_name":"Matt Devillier","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that, I guess, scope of design is also a big differentiator between the two projects.","startTime":"16:25","endTime":"16:32","speaker_name":"Matt Devillier","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay, yeah, that definitely help clarify things.","startTime":"16:33","endTime":"16:37","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And in coreboot today, what are the most common use cases.","startTime":"16:37","endTime":"16:41","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We spoke about Chromebooks.","startTime":"16:41","endTime":"16:43","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I know there's plenty of support for the newer thinkpads.","startTime":"16:43","endTime":"16:46","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What are the most common use cases?","startTime":"16:47","endTime":"16:48","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Is Server the most common use case or is it Chromeboxes or Chromebooks?","startTime":"16:48","endTime":"16:53","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What does that deployment footprint look like today?","startTime":"16:53","endTime":"16:55","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Or by guesstimate, I guess I would say by far.","startTime":"16:55","endTime":"16:59","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right now Chromebooks are the majority of the deployed devices running Core boot.","startTime":"16:59","endTime":"17:06","speaker_name":"Matt Devillier","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There are other x86 laptop vendors which ship devices running core boot.","startTime":"17:07","endTime":"17:14","speaker_name":"Matt Devillier","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But you know, by shipped volume of devices.","startTime":"17:14","endTime":"17:18","speaker_name":"Matt Devillier","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The nothing touches Core Boot or Chromebooks.","startTime":"17:18","endTime":"17:21","speaker_name":"Matt Devillier","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Just there's I don't know how many millions sold every year.","startTime":"17:21","endTime":"17:25","speaker_name":"Matt Devillier","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But yeah, it would dwarf any other class of devices.","startTime":"17:25","endTime":"17:31","speaker_name":"Matt Devillier","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, it is kind of.","startTime":"17:32","endTime":"17:34","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I was just going to jump in.","startTime":"17:35","endTime":"17:36","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It is kind of interesting though.","startTime":"17:36","endTime":"17:37","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You know, we are an open source project and we don't build any telemetry or information gathering into the firmware at all of course.","startTime":"17:37","endTime":"17:45","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So occasionally we do come, you know, we do hear about surprises where you know, someone's using coreboot in a, you know, some industrial machine.","startTime":"17:45","endTime":"17:54","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I actually, Werner Z, he's one of the core Boot leadership members, works at Siemens, the big industrial machinery company.","startTime":"17:54","endTime":"18:02","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And they put coreboot in a number of their products.","startTime":"18:03","endTime":"18:06","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You see them, you see some core boot systems and like thumbprint scanners like at airports, aerospace applications.","startTime":"18:07","endTime":"18:18","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So it's very distributed.","startTime":"18:19","endTime":"18:20","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It's in probably more places than you think.","startTime":"18:20","endTime":"18:23","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But as Matt was saying that the single biggest well known distributor is Chromebooks essentially and then followed by, you know, followed BY probably the Mr.","startTime":"18:23","endTime":"18:34","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Chromebox distribution going out to a bunch of people and then you know, system 76 laptops and some other, you know, niche products.","startTime":"18:34","endTime":"18:44","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah, okay.","startTime":"18:45","endTime":"18:47","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I must admit that I had stopped paying attention to biases after I guess switching to macOS in the early 2000s or mid 2000s.","startTime":"18:47","endTime":"18:56","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then I guess didn't really think about biases until a few years ago when we started to build our own hardware screenly and we started doing like security assessments.","startTime":"18:56","endTime":"19:05","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And that's when it dawned on me when you started do secure boot and all these things that actually I'm trusting this blob that I have no idea what it's doing and I have no idea how it's configured to do all the most sensitive things on the entire device.","startTime":"19:05","endTime":"19:21","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And if I can't trust that, I can't really trust anything that happens past that step.","startTime":"19:21","endTime":"19:26","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And that's really when I started getting excited about coreboot really.","startTime":"19:26","endTime":"19:29","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And that's why we are trying to get coreboot running on the next iteration of our signage player, because it's really, like, the only way we can, with confidence, say that I trust what's happening from you power this device on until it enters user space.","startTime":"19:29","endTime":"19:45","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"19:45","endTime":"19:45","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because I think it's almost crazy that nobody really talks about that, at least from my vantage point.","startTime":"19:45","endTime":"19:52","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I'm not sure what you are.","startTime":"19:52","endTime":"19:53","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"How you guys have seen that in general, your reflection on that in general.","startTime":"19:53","endTime":"19:58","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"20:00","endTime":"20:00","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I got to give the BIOS vendors some credit because oftentimes these PCs and a lot of devices, they work well enough that most people don't really have to think too hard about it.","startTime":"20:01","endTime":"20:13","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But it's when stuff goes wrong or you start actually digging into the surface and realizing that, oh, there's no way I can really tell what it's doing under the covers, then you start to realize, oh, wow, this is actually a huge problem.","startTime":"20:13","endTime":"20:27","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And especially if it's your job to make sure that it's secure, that it.","startTime":"20:27","endTime":"20:32","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You know, we've been seeing some vulnerabilities come out lately.","startTime":"20:32","endTime":"20:37","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I'm sure we'll talk about those later on.","startTime":"20:37","endTime":"20:39","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But, yeah, when.","startTime":"20:39","endTime":"20:40","speaker_name":"David

doesn't happen and you realize, oh, I can't.","startTime":"20:41","endTime":"20:45","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I can't audit this.","startTime":"20:45","endTime":"20:46","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I can't look at the source code.","startTime":"20:46","endTime":"20:48","speaker_name":"David

Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Exactly.","startTime":"20:57","endTime":"20:58","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Then it's called Learn.","startTime":"20:58","endTime":"21:00","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Learn to Helplessness, I think is the term.","startTime":"21:00","endTime":"21:02","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"21:02","endTime":"21:03","speaker_name":"David

really not the guy to solve it.","startTime":"21:11","endTime":"21:13","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"21:14","endTime":"21:15","speaker_name":"Viktor

Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"21:36","endTime":"21:36","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So that's kind of like why I was really keen on having you guys on the show here to just explore core bios.","startTime":"21:37","endTime":"21:44","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Open core.","startTime":"21:44","endTime":"21:45","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I can't speak right now.","startTime":"21:45","endTime":"21:46","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Core boot.","startTime":"21:46","endTime":"21:46","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I mean, and just, I guess, raise awareness for as well, because I think there's so much interesting stuff going on in here.","startTime":"21:47","endTime":"21:54","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we kind of talked a bit about security already with some vulnerabilities.","startTime":"21:55","endTime":"22:00","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But before we dive into these vulnerabilities that we have seen the last six months or so, let's talk Secure Boot and how that actually works.","startTime":"22:00","endTime":"22:08","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like what happens when I turn on Secure Boot and what walk me through like from boot process all the way through how that happens and how you can actually trust what happens and maybe we can open with that.","startTime":"22:08","endTime":"22:24","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I'm not sure what the best format to do that in, but I'm curious because they're walking that through the entire chain for serious events that happens.","startTime":"22:24","endTime":"22:31","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Now, when you say Secure boot, are you referring to UEFI Secure Boot or one of the many Secure Boot implementations that exist within Core Boot?","startTime":"22:32","endTime":"22:41","speaker_name":"Matt Devillier","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's, that's a good point.","startTime":"22:42","endTime":"22:44","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I was thinking about generic Secure Boot, but we, I'm happy to explore either of those or like how they differentiate as well, because that's an area I don't have a ton of expertise in.","startTime":"22:44","endTime":"22:53","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I've also met.","startTime":"22:53","endTime":"22:54","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Well, I think David can probably speak better to the Google Secure Verified boot model that is used on Chromebooks.","startTime":"22:58","endTime":"23:07","speaker_name":"Matt Devillier","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay, so yeah, let's see.","startTime":"23:09","endTime":"23:11","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"This is a fairly big topic.","startTime":"23:11","endTime":"23:13","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So we'll probably do, you know, we'll probably jump around a bit, so try to bear with us.","startTime":"23:13","endTime":"23:18","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So, yeah, so two main concepts.","startTime":"23:19","endTime":"23:22","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"There's measurement, where you know, you have one, you have the first thing that runs measure the second thing that runs before jumping to it.","startTime":"23:22","endTime":"23:30","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And measurement, you know, just means, gets a, you know, calculates the cryptographic hash and then if the hash matches what's expected, then okay, cool, the, this works.","startTime":"23:30","endTime":"23:40","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I'll jump to it.","startTime":"23:40","endTime":"23:41","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It's essentially a glorified checksum.","startTime":"23:41","endTime":"23:43","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And then that measures, the next thing jumps to it.","startTime":"23:43","endTime":"23:45","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"That measures the next thing jumps to it and so on, you know, from the reset vector on up to your operating system.","startTime":"23:45","endTime":"23:52","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And then there's the second concept, which is signature verification.","startTime":"23:54","endTime":"23:57","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So that doesn't tell you about the integrity, it doesn't tell you anything about like the contents of the binary.","startTime":"23:57","endTime":"24:04","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It just tells you who it was distributed by.","startTime":"24:04","endTime":"24:07","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"24:07","endTime":"24:07","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So like if you're just like if you sign an email and send it to a friend, you know, the signature is not necessarily checksuming your email, it's just telling your friend that yes, this email came from Victor because it's signed with his keys and I can validate.","startTime":"24:07","endTime":"24:20","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"24:20","endTime":"24:21","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So we do support a couple schema in Core Boot to deal with these.","startTime":"24:21","endTime":"24:27","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"The Verified Boot scheme that Chromebooks used, I was in on the early design of that I'm sure they've made improvements since then, but one of the main things we wanted was to avoid hardware like locking ourselves into a particular chips security model.","startTime":"24:28","endTime":"24:49","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"At the time I think bootguard was just kind of on the roadmap at intel and of course they were talking that up.","startTime":"24:49","endTime":"24:54","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"The ARM vendors of course had all their own secure boot schemes and we decided no, we want something that's simple that we can reuse across the product line and not have multiple security models.","startTime":"24:54","endTime":"25:08","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So I pointed out that Flash chips like Spy, nor Flash chips that are pretty much ubiquitous for x86 firmware typically have a write protect pin.","startTime":"25:08","endTime":"25:21","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So you can partition the Flash chip.","startTime":"25:22","endTime":"25:24","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You can say I want the upper half write protected and the lower half will be rewritable like field upgradable.","startTime":"25:24","endTime":"25:32","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And so that's what we did.","startTime":"25:32","endTime":"25:33","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"We put a read only copy of Coreboot in the upper partition on x86.","startTime":"25:34","endTime":"25:40","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"The upper part is where the reset vector is.","startTime":"25:40","endTime":"25:43","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You hit the power button, the processor starts executing code that's basically in the read only partition that verifies that the next thing that's going to be jumped to is valid and then it jumps to that.","startTime":"25:43","endTime":"25:58","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So the read only copy verifies the rewrite copy and then it jumps to it as soon as possible so that we can push field upgrades.","startTime":"25:59","endTime":"26:05","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And this was a very simple model that allowed us to use it across architectures, you know, amd, Intel ARM platforms.","startTime":"26:06","endTime":"26:15","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"There was even a MIPS platform in the mix at some point and the same security model worked all throughout.","startTime":"26:15","endTime":"26:21","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And another advantage was that it was easy for the owner of the device to take over.","startTime":"26:23","endTime":"26:29","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"This is actually something very important.","startTime":"26:29","endTime":"26:31","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I got to give props to the original Chrome OS team because at the time the PlayStation 3 had just been hacked and Sony was touting it's oh, it's unhackable or whatever.","startTime":"26:31","endTime":"26:42","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And then this teenage kid, George Hots, Geo Hot is his username I think managed to root it and own it.","startTime":"26:42","endTime":"26:50","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And then from there you had, you know, universities buying PlayStation threes below cost because of course they make their money on games and they get this pretty good hardware that they could run their high performance computing simulations on.","startTime":"26:50","endTime":"27:03","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So, so eventually so.","startTime":"27:03","endTime":"27:05","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So the idea tying that back to Chrome OS was like, okay, people are going to try to hack this thing.","startTime":"27:05","endTime":"27:10","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"We don't want to lock ourselves in, we don't want to, you know, back ourselves into a corner.","startTime":"27:10","endTime":"27:14","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"We want owners to be able to unlock the device.","startTime":"27:14","endTime":"27:18","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So early Chromebooks actually came with a physical switch.","startTime":"27:18","endTime":"27:21","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You could open up the case, void the warranty that was totally cool.","startTime":"27:21","endTime":"27:25","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Flip a switch to disable write protection and then put the case back together.","startTime":"27:25","endTime":"27:30","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"That would also have implications like the keys will get wiped out and things like that.","startTime":"27:31","endTime":"27:36","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So when the user booted up, if someone was trying to do this maliciously, they would see a screen that would warn them essentially.","startTime":"27:38","endTime":"27:45","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And they couldn't log into their Google account because the keys were wiped out essentially.","startTime":"27:45","endTime":"27:50","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And that was just to thwart physical attackers who might try to put a malicious BIOS on and install a key logger and things of that nature.","startTime":"27:50","endTime":"27:58","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So that was the idea

far?","startTime":"35:26","endTime":"35:28","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because I'm curious about how easy that would be to actually

yeah.","startTime":"01:03:58","endTime":"01:04:01","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So just a quick word on that one space that coreboot kind of found itself in recent years is circular economy or some people call it, I think you called it upcycling.","startTime":"01:04:01","endTime":"01:04:13","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And basically the idea is there's a lot of hardware out there that it runs perfectly fine, but people don't want it for whatever reason.","startTime":"01:04:14","endTime":"01:04:23","speaker_name":"David

this.","startTime":"01:05:45","endTime":"01:05:47","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"One way is, you know, you take off the cpu, you take off the dram, you take off any

to the Internet or the modern economy.","startTime":"01:07:30","endTime":"01:07:42","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So anyway, it's a great concept, but one of the problems is, to borrow an old phrase, hardware without software is, you know, a chip without software is just sand, right?","startTime":"01:07:43","endTime":"01:07:54","speaker_name":"David Hendricks","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So if you've got a server with, you know, firmware that has intractable problems, maybe it won't boot for some unknown reason, variables might be corrupted or it has known security issues and you wouldn't want to try to, you know, you can't really sell it with a support contract because that's where vendors will get a lot of money is, you know, here's a used server and I'll sell it to you and you know, 100 bucks a month gets you tech support or something like that.","startTime":"01:07:55","endTime":"01:08:23","speaker_name":"David
