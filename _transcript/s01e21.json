pleasure.","startTime":"00:13","endTime":"00:15","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's a really fun thing to have a hacker on the show.","startTime":"00:15","endTime":"00:19","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I've seen some of your Defcon talks and you've done some amazing things.","startTime":"00:19","endTime":"00:24","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And today's episode is going to be all about RFID hacking, or RF hacking, I guess more than RFID.","startTime":"00:24","endTime":"00:30","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So, yeah, no, it's going to be RFID hacking.","startTime":"00:30","endTime":"00:33","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"RFId hacking is not, it's not the same.","startTime":"00:33","endTime":"00:36","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Radio frequency is a completely different set of things and RFID is a little bit smaller.","startTime":"00:36","endTime":"00:41","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you can just.","startTime":"00:41","endTime":"00:43","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Quick thing if we.","startTime":"00:43","endTime":"00:45","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"RF is about the full spectrum with SDR software, defined radios, and you go for the spectrum.","startTime":"00:45","endTime":"00:52","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"RFID hacking is very limited to certain frequencies.","startTime":"00:52","endTime":"00:55","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So there's a low frequency, 125, you have a high frequency, about 13.56.","startTime":"00:55","endTime":"01:03","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Then you have ultra high frequency RFID, UHF.","startTime":"01:03","endTime":"01:07","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that's about 800 to 900.","startTime":"01:08","endTime":"01:11","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's the only frequency with we touch.","startTime":"01:11","endTime":"01:13","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We are very similar to RF sense because we into radio frequency or communications over the wires.","startTime":"01:13","endTime":"01:22","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Wireless, of course.","startTime":"01:22","endTime":"01:23","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"01:23","endTime":"01:24","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But it's not that.","startTime":"01:24","endTime":"01:25","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we also do a different thing.","startTime":"01:25","endTime":"01:27","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The low ff, lf and Hf is about inductance communications.","startTime":"01:27","endTime":"01:34","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we don't do sending, pushing out signals, but UHF does that.","startTime":"01:34","endTime":"01:40","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So crossover.","startTime":"01:40","endTime":"01:41","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"01:41","endTime":"01:42","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So big gray area, but fair enough.","startTime":"01:42","endTime":"01:43","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That's a good distinction.","startTime":"01:44","endTime":"01:45","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So if you are, if you do have your SDR software or hardware, you cannot necessarily do this.","startTime":"01:45","endTime":"01:53","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Or can that be used for the same.","startTime":"01:53","endTime":"01:54","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You can.","startTime":"01:54","endTime":"01:55","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's a very good question, though.","startTime":"01:56","endTime":"01:57","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's a great question.","startTime":"01:57","endTime":"01:58","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Some of the people who have sdrs, like with lime sdrs or blade RF or hack RF.","startTime":"01:59","endTime":"02:04","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Exactly.","startTime":"02:05","endTime":"02:05","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And you use better antennas, you can actually get down and sniff a little bit better sniffing because you can easily catch up the signals that comes out.","startTime":"02:05","endTime":"02:16","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So just short introduction to what it does.","startTime":"02:16","endTime":"02:19","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"RFID does, yeah.","startTime":"02:19","endTime":"02:21","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You take a proxmog, for instance.","startTime":"02:21","endTime":"02:23","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's an RFID reader and it has antenna on there and it generates a field, an electromagnetic field.","startTime":"02:23","endTime":"02:30","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And you put a, you take a card, an RFID based card.","startTime":"02:30","endTime":"02:38","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"02:38","endTime":"02:38","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It also has antenna in here.","startTime":"02:38","endTime":"02:39","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So when you present that card into the field of a reader, it energized because the magnetic field couples so the resonant in the same frequency, they are tuned to the same frequency.","startTime":"02:39","endTime":"02:51","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that makes the electron walk and excite the electrons.","startTime":"02:51","endTime":"02:55","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"02:55","endTime":"02:55","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So this one gets power by coming into the field over here.","startTime":"02:55","endTime":"02:58","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So with strs, they can sniff this communication because we have a field that pulse out and it goes further on, of course, but it doesn't send.","startTime":"02:58","endTime":"03:07","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right, we don't pulse out.","startTime":"03:07","endTime":"03:10","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you can't, so you can't power the chip or the card from SDR, but you can read it?","startTime":"03:10","endTime":"03:15","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You can sniff it.","startTime":"03:15","endTime":"03:16","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yes.","startTime":"03:16","endTime":"03:16","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"03:16","endTime":"03:17","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"good.","startTime":"03:17","endTime":"03:17","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"All right, that's a fair, that's a really good distinction.","startTime":"03:18","endTime":"03:20","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I got really excited about RFID hacking a few years ago.","startTime":"03:20","endTime":"03:26","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I lived in an apartment complex in London, and they only gave you one fob for my building.","startTime":"03:26","endTime":"03:31","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I was really annoyed by that because I was like, well, can I get another one?","startTime":"03:31","endTime":"03:35","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"They were like, oh yeah, that's two out of quid.","startTime":"03:35","endTime":"03:37","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I'm like, that's stupid.","startTime":"03:37","endTime":"03:38","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And it just so happened I went to DeFcon the same year.","startTime":"03:38","endTime":"03:41","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I was like, surely there is a better way for doing this.","startTime":"03:41","endTime":"03:44","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I picked up one of these RFID cloners that you can buy for, I don't know, like $100 or whatever.","startTime":"03:44","endTime":"03:51","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's not that expensive.","startTime":"03:51","endTime":"03:53","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Unfortunately, I didn't work for this particular use case because I did not know what technology to use for the Fob.","startTime":"03:54","endTime":"03:58","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But it kind of opened my eyes to the world of RFID hacking, and I've kind of been intrigued by that since.","startTime":"03:58","endTime":"04:05","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And that's kind of why I wanted to get you on the show, just properly nerd out about all things RFID.","startTime":"04:05","endTime":"04:11","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So maybe we can start with kind of like the one ones, the basics of RFID.","startTime":"04:13","endTime":"04:18","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like there are families of different types of RFID cards and readers and readers and categories of traffic, I guess, or frequencies.","startTime":"04:18","endTime":"04:30","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I presume what happened to me was that RFD cloner had could not do that particular key fob, but it can probably do other things.","startTime":"04:30","endTime":"04:38","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So maybe we can start there.","startTime":"04:38","endTime":"04:39","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like can you break down broadly the categories off different types of key fobs and, wow, room keys.","startTime":"04:39","endTime":"04:48","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"04:48","endTime":"04:49","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Wow, this is a wide topic.","startTime":"04:49","endTime":"04:51","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yes, I would imagine.","startTime":"04:51","endTime":"04:53","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I usually get questions about that RFID hacking.","startTime":"04:54","endTime":"04:56","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Can I clone my card?","startTime":"04:56","endTime":"04:58","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Number one question, without a doubt, right?","startTime":"04:58","endTime":"05:00","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And fully fair.","startTime":"05:00","endTime":"05:02","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And people go like, how hard can it be?","startTime":"05:02","endTime":"05:05","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's the next one, right?","startTime":"05:05","endTime":"05:06","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then they go like, I bought a cloner and it didn't work.","startTime":"05:06","endTime":"05:11","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And you're like, haha.","startTime":"05:12","endTime":"05:14","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And now you enter the realm of RFID hacking is one.","startTime":"05:14","endTime":"05:18","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"First step you have to do is actually what you just figure out.","startTime":"05:18","endTime":"05:21","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You have to identify the technology that's being used.","startTime":"05:21","endTime":"05:25","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then I need to figure out, does the cloner understand that technology and have a way to actually make a copy of that card?","startTime":"05:25","endTime":"05:34","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Does there exist a way to do that?","startTime":"05:35","endTime":"05:37","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because all technologies or all cards are not cloneable.","startTime":"05:38","endTime":"05:42","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"05:42","endTime":"05:43","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"05:43","endTime":"05:43","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we just start that out of questions.","startTime":"05:43","endTime":"05:45","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, when people go like, can I clone my passport?","startTime":"05:45","endTime":"05:47","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yes and no.","startTime":"05:48","endTime":"05:50","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"How much money do you have and.","startTime":"05:51","endTime":"05:52","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"How much time do you have?","startTime":"05:52","endTime":"05:54","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's actually like, you can't, and that's the whole thing.","startTime":"05:54","endTime":"05:58","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But some people can, and that's end of story.","startTime":"05:58","endTime":"06:02","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Same thing with payment cards, right?","startTime":"06:02","endTime":"06:04","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Without a doubt.","startTime":"06:04","endTime":"06:05","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Number second question is, like, can I clone my.","startTime":"06:05","endTime":"06:08","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I want to be able to pay with my implants.","startTime":"06:08","endTime":"06:11","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Biohacking is a big thing because they want to make these implants on your hand and you put inside everyone.","startTime":"06:12","endTime":"06:17","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, I've seen that.","startTime":"06:17","endTime":"06:17","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"They want to pay with your hand.","startTime":"06:18","endTime":"06:19","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's really cool.","startTime":"06:19","endTime":"06:20","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"06:20","endTime":"06:20","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But still, they have to move over the EMV data onto your chip, and that's, EMV doesn't really like that.","startTime":"06:21","endTime":"06:27","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So Mastercard and Europe pay.","startTime":"06:27","endTime":"06:29","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They really don't like that thing.","startTime":"06:29","endTime":"06:31","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So they want to have control of it.","startTime":"06:31","endTime":"06:33","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So they put on the cryptographic keys on the factories and very harsh about it, but you can do a semi version of it.","startTime":"06:33","endTime":"06:41","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Another thing that works for payments is downgrade attacks.","startTime":"06:41","endTime":"06:44","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You can do replays and stuff like that.","startTime":"06:44","endTime":"06:45","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That is kind of obvious because the traffic for EMV is not encrypted.","startTime":"06:45","endTime":"06:50","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But you cannot clone it per se.","startTime":"06:50","endTime":"06:52","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right back again to the thing.","startTime":"06:52","endTime":"06:54","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yes, you can, but you can't.","startTime":"06:54","endTime":"06:57","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's a Android store.","startTime":"06:59","endTime":"07:00","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I can't do a diver.","startTime":"07:00","endTime":"07:01","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it's okay.","startTime":"07:01","endTime":"07:02","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I can make a copy of some things, but I cannot do it.","startTime":"07:02","endTime":"07:05","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it works always.","startTime":"07:05","endTime":"07:06","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right?","startTime":"07:07","endTime":"07:07","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"07:07","endTime":"07:08","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So now we already touched base of payment cards, what you can and can't do, and then the top of cloners comes in.","startTime":"07:08","endTime":"07:14","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You showed off a kesey.","startTime":"07:14","endTime":"07:16","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's right.","startTime":"07:16","endTime":"07:17","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"07:17","endTime":"07:17","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that's Kisi was fun.","startTime":"07:17","endTime":"07:19","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I met the inventor in Zenzhen a couple of years ago, actually.","startTime":"07:19","endTime":"07:22","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"He was doing, you know, developing his, like you said, we talked about hardware before a little bit, and he was doing his first revisions and down over there.","startTime":"07:23","endTime":"07:29","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it's really hard to make business in China sometimes if you don't speak Chinese or Mandarin and bring it up.","startTime":"07:29","endTime":"07:36","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So apparently he was there for a year, and he went over to Mexico and finalized there.","startTime":"07:36","endTime":"07:41","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Anyway, the keys is kind of interesting because it clones low frequency, so it targets with 125 khz tags.","startTime":"07:41","endTime":"07:48","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"07:48","endTime":"07:49","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's usually only used for entry systems.","startTime":"07:49","endTime":"07:53","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Simple entry systems, kind of popular from Wycom.","startTime":"07:54","endTime":"07:56","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"From Scandinavia.","startTime":"07:56","endTime":"07:57","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's lots of those low frequency tags, but you can do that.","startTime":"07:57","endTime":"08:01","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So like you access key card for your hotel room and so on, right.","startTime":"08:01","endTime":"08:04","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Is that a common use case?","startTime":"08:05","endTime":"08:07","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"08:07","endTime":"08:08","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And now I have to do one thing.","startTime":"08:08","endTime":"08:10","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Wait.","startTime":"08:10","endTime":"08:10","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because that was the next thing I did.","startTime":"08:13","endTime":"08:14","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like the next hotel I stayed, I was like, all right, sure.","startTime":"08:14","endTime":"08:17","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That could use this case.","startTime":"08:17","endTime":"08:18","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"08:19","endTime":"08:20","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"My headset just went bananas for me.","startTime":"08:20","endTime":"08:22","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I can't hear your voice very well now, because it's what it is, I have to do one thing.","startTime":"08:22","endTime":"08:25","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Wait, that's all right.","startTime":"08:25","endTime":"08:26","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's right.","startTime":"08:26","endTime":"08:27","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I some hardware hacking live on stage.","startTime":"08:27","endTime":"08:29","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Let's see.","startTime":"08:31","endTime":"08:32","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Are you back?","startTime":"08:32","endTime":"08:32","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"08:33","endTime":"08:33","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Perfect.","startTime":"08:34","endTime":"08:35","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"08:35","endTime":"08:36","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So these are used mostly for access systems for hotel rooms and for buildings and so on, right?","startTime":"08:37","endTime":"08:44","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Oh, no, usually just enter passage entrance to doors, like simple doors to office buildings and stuff like that, or fraternities like that.","startTime":"08:44","endTime":"08:54","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So here comes another thing.","startTime":"08:55","endTime":"08:56","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Bring something down.","startTime":"08:56","endTime":"08:58","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yes.","startTime":"08:58","endTime":"08:59","speaker_name":"Viktor

hardware.","startTime":"09:01","endTime":"09:02","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So Kesey works by now very easily put the card, you put your little reader, it's very smooth.","startTime":"09:03","endTime":"09:10","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You put it on and put it on the card and then you put it on where you want to clone it to.","startTime":"09:10","endTime":"09:13","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Very simple.","startTime":"09:13","endTime":"09:14","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That stemmed from this little vice.","startTime":"09:14","endTime":"09:16","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"This is what we call the blue gun cloner.","startTime":"09:16","endTime":"09:19","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"This is a low frequency em

nothing.","startTime":"18:57","endTime":"19:00","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And this is the thing, what I started doing is like, oh yeah, but I'm quite good at that.","startTime":"19:00","endTime":"19:04","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So let's learn c again and learn about embedded and doing that.","startTime":"19:05","endTime":"19:11","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I started doing things, but it was a rough place.","startTime":"19:11","endTime":"19:14","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So Iceman was just a user then.","startTime":"19:14","endTime":"19:17","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But after a year I think I posted, I'm the guy who has the most question on the whole Proxmox

to do things the hard way, you know, you should be reading a raw signal trace and then you see a plot window and you should be able to manually decode that to bits and ones and zeros.","startTime":"19:37","endTime":"19:48","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then, you know, from there you should be able to twist and decode that one into a vegan pack

interesting.","startTime":"19:54","endTime":"19:57","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I learned that now, but not very functional because I can't use this.","startTime":"19:57","endTime":"20:01","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If I have to do this, every time I want to look at the cardinal, it's gonna, I'm gonna go nuts.","startTime":"20:01","endTime":"20:06","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I started doing those changes because I wanted something that the proximal client to work in the way that I want to work with it how I want to see, right?","startTime":"20:06","endTime":"20:14","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I forced, you know, you start changing the

want to do it.","startTime":"20:22","endTime":"20:29","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you say, why do you want to do that?","startTime":"20:29","endTime":"20:30","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Very protective Og

something?","startTime":"20:33","endTime":"20:36","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then I realized, well, I can just make a fork right of it.","startTime":"20:36","endTime":"20:40","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then Iceman fork was born.","startTime":"20:40","endTime":"20:43","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then I did my changes there and made sure that upstream things comes in as well.","startTime":"20:43","endTime":"20:48","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it didn't matter what they wanted or not wanted.","startTime":"20:48","endTime":"20:51","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I can just do it how I wanted it to become.","startTime":"20:51","endTime":"20:54","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I did open

it starts.","startTime":"20:57","endTime":"20:58","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's a beautiful

it.","startTime":"20:59","endTime":"21:00","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it started with that idea of always becoming more and more

better.","startTime":"21:07","endTime":"21:08","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Another thing that adds, in the beginning there was the static analyzing, this continuous Covid scan.","startTime":"21:09","endTime":"21:17","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's what it called that make analyzing because it's C code and we always have memory leaks and all that crappy code styles and proxmograph Washington full of it.","startTime":"21:17","endTime":"21:25","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But you know, gradually you start taking away all those problems, starts to become better and better.","startTime":"21:25","endTime":"21:30","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Better.","startTime":"21:31","endTime":"21:31","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And you figure out more and more formats.","startTime":"21:31","endTime":"21:33","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We figure out more and more how to clone, how to read more in ellipse stuff, enhanced and made the high tag or not just the high tech we made for classic attacks, made them better, working more faster.","startTime":"21:33","endTime":"21:47","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And all of that started, ended up.","startTime":"21:47","endTime":"21:48","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So this is where Iceman started showing up everywhere.","startTime":"21:49","endTime":"21:52","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"This is where people know about the Eisenman fork and who that is.","startTime":"21:52","endTime":"21:56","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"This is why I ended up doing all this code.","startTime":"21:57","endTime":"22:01","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And from there, I never been entered conference, I never been to Devcon, I never done anything like that.","startTime":"22:01","endTime":"22:08","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I was all of a sudden a maintainer.","startTime":"22:08","endTime":"22:12","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then I was also administrator of approximate forums.","startTime":"22:12","endTime":"22:16","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And, you know, people was like, yeah, okay.","startTime":"22:16","endTime":"22:17","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You seem to burn for community as well, which I

stuff.","startTime":"23:14","endTime":"23:19","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we created a company called RFID Research Group, and we made the RB four, an improved version of approxmox, small handled, easy, sleek, better antennas, and overall nice.","startTime":"23:19","endTime":"23:33","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And we made a Kickstarter out of that one.","startTime":"23:33","endTime":"23:35","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It was actually very successful.","startTime":"23:36","endTime":"23:37","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it came to fruition and all of a sudden I was like, yeah, we have to go out and talk about this product as well.","startTime":"23:37","endTime":"23:44","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Stuff like that.","startTime":"23:44","endTime":"23:44","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I did that a little bit and then started my career as talker on different conferences, which I

fraud out of it.","startTime":"25:08","endTime":"25:15","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's why people ask about payments and bus tickets and laundry or coffee machines or you name it, they asked.","startTime":"25:15","endTime":"25:25","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, but I think that's for me, it was always like the pursuit of understanding.","startTime":"25:25","endTime":"25:30","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I want to understand how it works.","startTime":"25:30","endTime":"25:32","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It made me realize like, oh, shit, there's a crypto key in there.","startTime":"25:32","endTime":"25:35","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That makes it harder to clone it.","startTime":"25:35","endTime":"25:37","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, that's clever.","startTime":"25:37","endTime":"25:38","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And that leads you to, like, NFC, and now you have better grasping of like, how NFC contactless pay work and like, because they're all kind of the same family

yeah.","startTime":"25:48","endTime":"25:48","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Oh yeah.","startTime":"25:49","endTime":"25:49","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"NFC is one of the worst names, though, because everybody says, oh, RFID and

correctly.","startTime":"26:00","endTime":"26:02","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And people go, no, it's NFC.","startTime":"26:03","endTime":"26:04","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's like, no, it's like, yes, but it's a task group and they're very good at it.","startTime":"26:04","endTime":"26:08","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So within RFID is a lot of ISO standards, right?","startTime":"26:08","endTime":"26:12","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And work groups like NFC group, right?","startTime":"26:12","endTime":"26:15","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So they make an NFC readers what you see in phones, they're very good at that.","startTime":"26:15","endTime":"26:19","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And they use a protocol that use NDEF standard or something about NDEF messages.","startTime":"26:19","endTime":"26:24","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's why you can send your business card and stuff like that over your phone like that,

very high tech, but it's another level on top, built on top of different ISO standards, how to communicate physically with

like a protocol on top of it.","startTime":"26:42","endTime":"26:44","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it's used for everything, but it always goes across surfing.","startTime":"26:44","endTime":"26:48","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So MDF use is very much of apus.","startTime":"26:48","endTime":"26:51","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So for one of the systems, payment system does the same

pack it up so you can see it goes back and left, up and down, and you need to keep track of it.","startTime":"27:10","endTime":"27:17","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"One of the things when you do RFID hacking is that you want to look at the traffic that's happening, because just doing it, like having a reader writing, doing things is good, but you don't learn anything from it.","startTime":"27:17","endTime":"27:29","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that's why the Proxmox is what we call the swiss army knife of things for RFID hacking, because you can look at the signal on the lower levels, you can look at it on the package tracements, in a sense.","startTime":"27:29","endTime":"27:41","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We don't have wireshark in that sense, but we have annotations and trace logs.","startTime":"27:41","endTime":"27:45","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There is a mode where you can actually export it to wireshark.","startTime":"27:45","endTime":"27:49","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So someone made a wireshark plugin for it somewhere.","startTime":"27:49","endTime":"27:53","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Apparently you can look at the ISO 1443 a packages from there.","startTime":"27:53","endTime":"27:57","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I'm like, cool.","startTime":"27:57","endTime":"27:58","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yes.","startTime":"28:01","endTime":"28:02","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I think what's interesting, like here is if for the most basic cards, essentially it's an identifier, right.","startTime":"28:03","endTime":"28:10","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's just like if you swipe the card and you get like a string of text, essentially, right?","startTime":"28:10","endTime":"28:14","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"In various ways.","startTime":"28:14","endTime":"28:15","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But the obvious thing is like, well, that's just a replay attack waiting to happen.","startTime":"28:15","endTime":"28:21","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right?","startTime":"28:21","endTime":"28:21","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So what are the mitigation strategies in place for some of these cards?","startTime":"28:21","endTime":"28:27","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Some of them have cryptographic id, so I presume there's a clock of sorts in there that generates a timestamp.","startTime":"28:27","endTime":"28:31","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you, like, there's a time delay and, like, so you can't do the replay attack.","startTime":"28:31","endTime":"28:35","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Well, how does that.","startTime":"28:35","endTime":"28:35","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"How does it actually look like?","startTime":"28:35","endTime":"28:36","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Or is it way too.","startTime":"28:36","endTime":"28:37","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I hear that you from a completely different set of stories of computers.","startTime":"28:37","endTime":"28:41","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"One, remember one thing.","startTime":"28:43","endTime":"28:45","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Now, RFID is an old, young technology, but it's very low power, right.","startTime":"28:45","endTime":"28:51","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The ICs on a card is very simple.","startTime":"28:51","endTime":"28:54","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So the simplest one from the low frequency we talked about before, just shouted out the five bytes of information that was there, the EM 4100.","startTime":"28:55","endTime":"29:05","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So the Proxmo quadrant, developed by a guy called Jonathan Bestieu's, as in his masterpieces, where he wanted to prove the state of the governor of California that the Veritas chips that they were trying to implement as an id cardinal for schools is crap.","startTime":"29:05","endTime":"29:21","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And you shouldn't do it because you can very easily capture the data and then replay it.","startTime":"29:21","endTime":"29:25","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that's why you did this.","startTime":"29:25","endTime":"29:27","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That was 2006, okay?","startTime":"29:27","endTime":"29:30","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"29:30","endTime":"29:30","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that's where it started there.","startTime":"29:30","endTime":"29:32","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then some other very smart people, researchers starting attacking and looking into the more secure versions of RFID cards.","startTime":"29:32","endTime":"29:42","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So low frequency is usually very simple.","startTime":"29:42","endTime":"29:45","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"29:45","endTime":"29:46","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There's one exception, and that's high tag, the high tag family.","startTime":"29:46","endTime":"29:50","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And they have a crypto, so that's a handshake of crypto, but it's also.","startTime":"29:51","endTime":"29:55","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's very similar to my crypto one because it's developed by the same people, by Philips, and they attack that one and they recover keys how we do it.","startTime":"29:55","endTime":"30:05","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it has a crypto chip on there with a private key that no sealed.","startTime":"30:06","endTime":"30:10","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's not a crypto ship, it's only one IC.","startTime":"30:10","endTime":"30:13","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right?","startTime":"30:13","endTime":"30:13","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Oh, okay.","startTime":"30:14","endTime":"30:14","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So it's one system on chip in that sense, that runs its things, that have some crypto things that's hard coded into it in the beginning.","startTime":"30:14","endTime":"30:22","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"30:22","endTime":"30:22","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So the more years comes, the more advanced the ICs became, and they added proper crypto and proper dedicated more parts of hardware for it, and you can actually run like Java machines on it.","startTime":"30:22","endTime":"30:37","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So like a secure development style crypto, stuff like that.","startTime":"30:37","endTime":"30:41","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So if you take an EnV cards, they are more likely running on a smart chip inside of there than actually.","startTime":"30:41","endTime":"30:49","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I see.","startTime":"30:49","endTime":"30:49","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"30:50","endTime":"30:51","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So 2006 and 2010 is when other researchers start hacking the Mifare classic cards and coming up with a crypto key that's ended up with me ending up in this world.","startTime":"30:51","endTime":"31:01","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And the same thing for you, going, oh, hold on, those cards are more like a USB stick.","startTime":"31:01","endTime":"31:09","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They are like memory cards.","startTime":"31:09","endTime":"31:11","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"All of a sudden they start screaming out the UID as well in anti collision process.","startTime":"31:11","endTime":"31:17","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But after that they are like a USB stick memory stick.","startTime":"31:17","endTime":"31:20","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It has memory and it's divided into sectors and blocks.","startTime":"31:20","endTime":"31:24","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Those sectors has two keys and access rights.","startTime":"31:25","endTime":"31:28","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So in order to get rid of the memory, in order to do a clone of a card, you need to break the keys.","startTime":"31:28","endTime":"31:34","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that's how it improved.","startTime":"31:35","endTime":"31:38","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And in the more later ones, like NXP desfire, they have added proper crypto like AE's and encrypted channels, dedicated hardware and Eil five plus certifications.","startTime":"31:38","endTime":"31:51","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so they're really good.","startTime":"31:51","endTime":"31:54","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You don't hack both, right?","startTime":"31:54","endTime":"31:56","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Not me, not you.","startTime":"31:56","endTime":"31:57","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I would imagine the only way is to do so kind of downgrade attack on those cards then if you were to.","startTime":"31:58","endTime":"32:04","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Or is that even possible?","startTime":"32:04","endTime":"32:05","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Oh, look at that.","startTime":"32:05","endTime":"32:06","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Someone has been reading up on things.","startTime":"32:06","endTime":"32:07","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Downgrade attacks is a concept.","startTime":"32:08","endTime":"32:10","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yes, it's a very interesting concept, because in physical access control world, this is more one of the standard attacks there is that you have a reader, and for access control, physical access control vendors, they choose a protocol called VGAN to communicate between the reader and the microcontroller behind doors that decides to open the door strikes or not.","startTime":"32:10","endTime":"32:37","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And by doing so, you can easily swap out the readers as long as it spoke vgana.","startTime":"32:37","endTime":"32:43","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you can put up a low frequency technology reader of different sorts, or you could put up a high frequency one that was for I class or desk fire or 14 a or 14 b, whatever you want to put on, as long as you spoke v gan and talk back.","startTime":"32:43","endTime":"33:00","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That way the door opened.","startTime":"33:01","endTime":"33:01","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that's just plain text protocol, right?","startTime":"33:02","endTime":"33:03","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That was in plain text protocol, yes.","startTime":"33:03","endTime":"33:05","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's why we do this on wire sniffering and all that attacks you've seen, right.","startTime":"33:06","endTime":"33:09","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You get to that in a second.","startTime":"33:09","endTime":"33:10","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But yeah, I, because I think that's worth zooming in on.","startTime":"33:10","endTime":"33:13","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So the downgrade attacks is like, does the reader support multiple different versions of COD technology?","startTime":"33:13","endTime":"33:22","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Does it support a legacy or a simpler version?","startTime":"33:23","endTime":"33:26","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If it does, Bob's your uncle, you just take the data out from vegan wires, put that data on a lower secure credential, and then you have a copy of, but it works.","startTime":"33:26","endTime":"33:38","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"33:38","endTime":"33:39","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I mean, I think these things are like, well, what makes me love the concept of like, red teaming.","startTime":"33:39","endTime":"33:45","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Really?","startTime":"33:45","endTime":"33:45","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like, you never attack the strongest security parameter.","startTime":"33:45","endTime":"33:50","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You always find for the weakest link.","startTime":"33:50","endTime":"33:51","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And in this case, just like, well, okay, you have all this fans security to check the card, but if I just lift this out and put a sniffer behind it, like, what's the point?","startTime":"33:51","endTime":"34:02","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like, it's not a complicated attack.","startTime":"34:03","endTime":"34:06","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The thing with red teaming, when you talk to those guys and pen testers who do physical access, they always get in.","startTime":"34:06","endTime":"34:13","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That is the least of their concerns.","startTime":"34:14","endTime":"34:16","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's like, oh, yeah, we put on two multifactors, biometric and all that stuff.","startTime":"34:16","endTime":"34:20","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They got in anyway.","startTime":"34:20","endTime":"34:21","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Somebody left the door open, the cleaner forgot the closet.","startTime":"34:21","endTime":"34:25","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like, oh, yeah, cool.","startTime":"34:25","endTime":"34:26","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, like, you know they're going to get in.","startTime":"34:26","endTime":"34:28","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's not a problem.","startTime":"34:29","endTime":"34:29","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So, yeah, and that's, this is where I started saying to people, for commercial properties like that or for your entering your multi tenant house, is it's secure enough.","startTime":"34:30","endTime":"34:41","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It gives you a feeling that it's secure and you can't easily do it, but it's not secure.","startTime":"34:41","endTime":"34:48","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's secure enough.","startTime":"34:48","endTime":"34:49","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean, yeah, that's why I want to have another episode later on lock picking because I think that's equally interesting because it's a perception of like, people believe locks are safe, you believe key tags are safe, but to a great degree, they are nothing.","startTime":"34:50","endTime":"35:05","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"No, it's an illusion of security rather than real security.","startTime":"35:06","endTime":"35:09","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yes.","startTime":"35:10","endTime":"35:10","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And what many people are interested in RFID hacking medicine is that we want to tell the story that the vendors are saying something.","startTime":"35:12","endTime":"35:20","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And by the RFID hacking community, you have now the tools to prove if that statement is correct or false.","startTime":"35:21","endTime":"35:30","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So let's zoom in on that for a second.","startTime":"35:31","endTime":"35:34","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So a lot of alarm systems these days are using RFID dongles, both in commercial buildings, but even increasingly residential buildings.","startTime":"35:34","endTime":"35:44","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's becoming more like if you buy a new lock, like, oh, do you want the smart version of your lock more often?","startTime":"35:44","endTime":"35:49","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"They're usually more stupid than smart, but that's a different.","startTime":"35:49","endTime":"35:51","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But when you go to like assabloy, whatever, one of these lock companies, and they sell you a smart lock, how secure are those?","startTime":"35:53","endTime":"36:02","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What standards are they using to actually secure this?","startTime":"36:02","endTime":"36:05","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Are they somewhat secure against cloning or are they actually a downgrade from a traditional lock?","startTime":"36:05","endTime":"36:12","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, I like where this is going.","startTime":"36:13","endTime":"36:18","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Well, okay, let's see.","startTime":"36:19","endTime":"36:24","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Let's decode that one a little bit.","startTime":"36:24","endTime":"36:26","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"One of the most common thing now is to have Bluetooth right.","startTime":"36:27","endTime":"36:32","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So something that they call mobile credentials.","startTime":"36:32","endTime":"36:35","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"36:35","endTime":"36:36","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So the mobile credential lives in your phone, it lives in a secure element and it's very high crypto because the phone has the compute power and memory to do this stuff.","startTime":"36:36","endTime":"36:45","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"36:45","endTime":"36:46","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that part is very secure.","startTime":"36:46","endTime":"36:49","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yes.","startTime":"36:49","endTime":"36:49","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"However, over and over again, this is outside already hacking because now we're going into different technology.","startTime":"36:50","endTime":"36:56","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So with Bluetooth, like everything else, right.","startTime":"36:56","endTime":"36:59","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"As soon as you can capture the signals, because you can do that before.","startTime":"36:59","endTime":"37:02","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But once you start learning SDR and you're capturing Bluetooth signals and you know how to use the tools, you can also replay things.","startTime":"37:03","endTime":"37:10","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"37:10","endTime":"37:11","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And if you don't have a session protocol in that sense in place, those simple Bluetooth locks is very like you just replay, you just record the first opening and then you just replay it.","startTime":"37:11","endTime":"37:24","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you go by the day before, put little battery powered sniffer next to the doorway and then you come back the next day.","startTime":"37:24","endTime":"37:31","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Well, you don't have to do that ever.","startTime":"37:31","endTime":"37:32","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's Bluetooth, it's designed to distance, right?","startTime":"37:32","endTime":"37:35","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you just need a badass antenna.","startTime":"37:35","endTime":"37:37","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You can sit several meters away, hundreds of meters.","startTime":"37:37","endTime":"37:40","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But it comes to that is a completely different story.","startTime":"37:42","endTime":"37:44","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So this is why it's so fun when you go to Defcon and you go to the radio frequency village or RF hacker sanctuary, right?","startTime":"37:44","endTime":"37:51","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So they teach all of that stuff there.","startTime":"37:51","endTime":"37:53","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They have an excellent CTF that you can play.","startTime":"37:53","endTime":"37:56","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So RF CTF via Devcon, it's well worth it.","startTime":"37:56","endTime":"37:59","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Runs by Ricks.","startTime":"37:59","endTime":"38:00","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Big shout out to those guys and they are really good.","startTime":"38:00","endTime":"38:04","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So if you want to learn the latest and tricks and things, how to do things, you go there and you realize, oh my God.","startTime":"38:04","endTime":"38:12","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But this is yet again, it comes down to costs and administrative money to do this, to secure things with Bluetooth and mobile credentials as is right now it's pretty secure.","startTime":"38:13","endTime":"38:26","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But as always, there are tons of interest.","startTime":"38:27","endTime":"38:30","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"As soon as there's a lock, there's a ton of interest among people out there and they're very dedicated to find out there's some bugs and they want to prove to people that they can actually pass by and penetrate that system.","startTime":"38:30","endTime":"38:43","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So there are some interesting talks at Defcon this year, talking about how the secure element on the I class of CIO systems is not proper or they managed to extract the key materials from there.","startTime":"38:43","endTime":"38:55","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And yeah, so that's the same key material that is used for Bluetooth credentials as well.","startTime":"38:55","endTime":"39:01","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So yeah, it comes down to the keys.","startTime":"39:01","endTime":"39:05","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"In the end of the day, if you find the keys somehow you can extract it.","startTime":"39:05","endTime":"39:08","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's game over.","startTime":"39:09","endTime":"39:09","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It doesn't matter.","startTime":"39:09","endTime":"39:10","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It doesn't matter if you have the latest 4000 bits or diffie Hellman or whatever shit you use.","startTime":"39:10","endTime":"39:17","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, yeah.","startTime":"39:17","endTime":"39:19","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"If you have access to that, it doesn't really matter.","startTime":"39:19","endTime":"39:22","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"39:22","endTime":"39:22","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so walk me back to like, the toolkit that you use.","startTime":"39:23","endTime":"39:27","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Obviously you have your hardware, the pocmark.","startTime":"39:27","endTime":"39:31","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And in terms of like, if you go back to the scenario where you try to do your cloning of your bust card that you had ten years ago or 15 years, how many years back that was, how would that process look like with approximately three today or four?","startTime":"39:31","endTime":"39:47","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Sorry, it's proxima free, but auto v four, it's okay.","startTime":"39:47","endTime":"39:52","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's a silly world.","startTime":"39:52","endTime":"39:53","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's tons of

what?","startTime":"01:01:57","endTime":"01:01:58","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"How secure are

so.","startTime":"01:03:13","endTime":"01:03:14","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"To be honest, I haven't looked into that one, but I doubt that they take those kinds of attacks in

could.","startTime":"01:03:15","endTime":"01:03:28","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Stand outside and just broadcast it,

have to be physically there.","startTime":"01:03:38","endTime":"01:03:40","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that's the

should be able, if you access to the house, whatever to do, you know, to make a simulation and then you change the data that is needed to iterate the different things and you keep on doing it until you figure, hit the pay dirt.","startTime":"01:03:43","endTime":"01:03:56","speaker_name":"Iceman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean, that's another way of when we do RFID hacking is to let the
