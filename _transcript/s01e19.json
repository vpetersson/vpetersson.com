we've been bumping into each other at various conferences.","startTime":"00:19","endTime":"00:22","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think last conference was state of open con, I believe.","startTime":"00:22","endTime":"00:25","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And that's when I realized that I should have you on the

Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yes.","startTime":"00:31","endTime":"00:32","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The London scenes.","startTime":"00:33","endTime":"00:34","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, there's a lot of people who I kind of met through those things, even from way back when, like a lot of days before, even before I joined Docker.","startTime":"00:34","endTime":"00:46","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There's people I met back then in the years.","startTime":"00:46","endTime":"00:50","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's been a great place to meet people.","startTime":"00:51","endTime":"00:52","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean, the London Kubernetes scene in particular.","startTime":"00:53","endTime":"00:55","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And obviously that spilled into the.","startTime":"00:55","endTime":"00:57","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Well that started with the docker scene.","startTime":"00:57","endTime":"00:58","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The Kubernetes scene was way ahead, London pushed well, by its weight, or punched way above its weight, I would say, from that perspective.","startTime":"00:58","endTime":"01:08","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So there was a lot of strong DevOps people in London that really kicked things off.","startTime":"01:08","endTime":"01:14","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So it was a really good scene to be in those days, I think.","startTime":"01:14","endTime":"01:16","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"01:16","endTime":"01:17","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And.","startTime":"01:18","endTime":"01:19","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"All right, so let's talk a bit more about Docker, because you are the CTO of Docker.","startTime":"01:19","endTime":"01:24","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So let's talk about Docker.","startTime":"01:24","endTime":"01:25","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I have some other topics, but we're largely themed around Docker.","startTime":"01:25","endTime":"01:28","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So with that, let's start with a very simple question.","startTime":"01:28","endTime":"01:31","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What was your first docker experience?","startTime":"01:32","endTime":"01:33","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So my first docker experience was.","startTime":"01:34","endTime":"01:38","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean, it was.","startTime":"01:39","endTime":"01:40","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It was.","startTime":"01:44","endTime":"01:45","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I can't remember exactly what the first experience was.","startTime":"01:51","endTime":"01:56","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I remember roughly when it was.","startTime":"01:56","endTime":"01:58","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It was.","startTime":"01:58","endTime":"01:59","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It was.","startTime":"02:00","endTime":"02:01","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It must have been about ten years ago.","startTime":"02:03","endTime":"02:09","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I've been a doctor for nine years.","startTime":"02:10","endTime":"02:11","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it was.","startTime":"02:11","endTime":"02:12","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think it was around a year before that, maybe a little bit somewhere in that area, you know, as you say, there was a kind of.","startTime":"02:12","endTime":"02:20","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There was that strong London scene where, you know, things were.","startTime":"02:22","endTime":"02:27","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Things were happening.","startTime":"02:27","endTime":"02:28","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"My.","startTime":"02:28","endTime":"02:28","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I was.","startTime":"02:28","endTime":"02:29","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I had a.","startTime":"02:29","endTime":"02:30","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"My first kind of experience in the kind of DevOps space really was puppethe I was doing.","startTime":"02:31","endTime":"02:37","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I did a bunch of what we called sysadmin work back then, before it was DevOps.","startTime":"02:37","endTime":"02:42","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I came across this automation stuff, and I thought, hold on, this puppet thing that's actually different from the other stuff and this terrible manual configuration work that were doing before that.","startTime":"02:43","endTime":"02:55","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that kind of got me interested overall in what was changing.","startTime":"02:56","endTime":"03:00","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I was always interested in kind of this sort of system manageability area.","startTime":"03:01","endTime":"03:07","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I actually ran the London Coreos meetup for a while.","startTime":"03:07","endTime":"03:12","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Oh yeah, thats a blast of the past.","startTime":"03:12","endTime":"03:14","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think the next thing after puppet I got cited by was actually the kind of the really early coreos when it was ETCD.","startTime":"03:15","endTime":"03:22","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that was a thing to manage your distributed etsy which was like before it was, you know before it was actually really about containerization.","startTime":"03:23","endTime":"03:35","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And somewhere in that period I ran into Docker.","startTime":"03:35","endTime":"03:40","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean I think the first kind of formal thing I don't.","startTime":"03:43","endTime":"03:48","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We worked on a joint ebook on using Docker with a bunch of us back in somewhere in that period I wrote a Docker security chapter for that book.","startTime":"03:48","endTime":"04:01","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So.","startTime":"04:02","endTime":"04:03","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But yeah, somewhere around.","startTime":"04:04","endTime":"04:05","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So container security was something that, because I was always something I was interested in really early on and yeah so it was around that period.","startTime":"04:05","endTime":"04:19","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I don't actually remember the, I actually remember the first Docker run experience.","startTime":"04:19","endTime":"04:25","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It must have, which is kind of disappointing.","startTime":"04:25","endTime":"04:28","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I should be happy to be able to say oh yeah, the first time I did Docker run I thought this is the future and I'm going to end up working at Docker.","startTime":"04:28","endTime":"04:33","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But it didn't actually work out like that at all.","startTime":"04:34","endTime":"04:35","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, I mean I remember my first Docker experience and it was such a mind boggling experience from a, I guess principal perspective in the sense of like you came from vms and now you came with this concept.","startTime":"04:36","endTime":"04:51","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I mean I've been using like freebiece to JRS and whatnot in the past, which is kind of similar, but it was just this mind shift of like is a single process and that took a bit of time to get your head around, I guess.","startTime":"04:51","endTime":"05:02","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And you still see a lot of people trying to get their head around that, even to this day.","startTime":"05:02","endTime":"05:06","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"05:06","endTime":"05:06","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So let's talk a bit about, well obviously you have a lot of exposure to the community, I presume, with Docker.","startTime":"05:08","endTime":"05:15","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So what do you see as the most common like misconceptions about Docker?","startTime":"05:15","endTime":"05:19","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Well, I don't know.","startTime":"05:20","endTime":"05:22","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think that there's a number of things.","startTime":"05:22","endTime":"05:25","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean it's not so much misconceptions.","startTime":"05:25","endTime":"05:28","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think it's a matter of people having different ideas about what the, you know, what the important changes that happened in the world are because of Docker or with Docker by using Docker and what the way to frame it is for so many years at the beginning, you know, beginning and it's a little bit less so now, but it still comes up, you know there's the VMS versus containers.","startTime":"05:28","endTime":"05:55","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, that's a thing.","startTime":"05:56","endTime":"05:57","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that, like.","startTime":"05:57","endTime":"05:58","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And the idea that this is an important distinction, I think, is really misleading.","startTime":"05:58","endTime":"06:05","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think, you know, obviously, like, people frame things in terms of what came, what they were doing before, but it wasn't ever really a VMS versus containers in the sense it.","startTime":"06:05","endTime":"06:20","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And sometimes you got the impression that it might go down that route.","startTime":"06:20","endTime":"06:23","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I think it became a sort of, this is the way we talk about Docker thing, not a really useful thing, because I think that a lot of the VMS versus containers discussion was actually about efficiency of isolation.","startTime":"06:23","endTime":"06:39","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, were containers sufficiently isolated?","startTime":"06:39","endTime":"06:42","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And as a security boundary or not?","startTime":"06:43","endTime":"06:45","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But there were two things about that.","startTime":"06:46","endTime":"06:48","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"One is the answer for, you know, for multi tenancy purposes was no.","startTime":"06:48","endTime":"06:53","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"06:53","endTime":"06:54","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that was fairly clear for quite a long time that the answer for multi tenancy was no.","startTime":"06:55","endTime":"07:01","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"For single tenancy.","startTime":"07:01","endTime":"07:03","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Well, yes.","startTime":"07:03","endTime":"07:04","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, actually, single tendency.","startTime":"07:04","endTime":"07:06","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Isolation wasn't that important.","startTime":"07:06","endTime":"07:08","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's better than nothing.","startTime":"07:08","endTime":"07:09","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, it's better than nothing.","startTime":"07:09","endTime":"07:11","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Absolutely better than nothing.","startTime":"07:11","endTime":"07:12","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Better than running processes on the same VM without any isolation.","startTime":"07:12","endTime":"07:16","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But the security boundary wasn't what made Docker successful.","startTime":"07:17","endTime":"07:22","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And the framing of containers versus VMS really was trying to frame it in terms of that.","startTime":"07:23","endTime":"07:28","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it was a very confused conversation over the.","startTime":"07:28","endTime":"07:32","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The eight years or so.","startTime":"07:32","endTime":"07:34","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It was that often the main conversation about containers was containers versus vms.","startTime":"07:34","endTime":"07:38","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, it wasn't very helpful to anyone trying to, like trying to adopt, because it didn't tell you what the benefits of using containers were, which wouldn't, and what the reasons that containers around were.","startTime":"07:38","endTime":"07:52","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They weren't there to repair.","startTime":"07:52","endTime":"07:54","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Almost everyone who uses containers in a vm.","startTime":"07:55","endTime":"07:59","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like.","startTime":"07:59","endTime":"07:59","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"07:59","endTime":"07:59","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like many things in the.","startTime":"08:00","endTime":"08:02","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"In, you know, in our ecosystem, they were largely additive, not replacing.","startTime":"08:02","endTime":"08:07","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so there wasn't really, for most people, averse at all.","startTime":"08:07","endTime":"08:12","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They were going to use both.","startTime":"08:12","endTime":"08:13","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it.","startTime":"08:15","endTime":"08:16","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But the implicit story was about security isolation.","startTime":"08:16","endTime":"08:19","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And was the security isolation good enough?","startTime":"08:19","endTime":"08:22","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But that, like, literally for most people, that really wasn't the issue.","startTime":"08:22","endTime":"08:26","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It wasn't why they were using containers.","startTime":"08:26","endTime":"08:27","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It wasn't important.","startTime":"08:27","endTime":"08:28","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, I think the.","startTime":"08:30","endTime":"08:31","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean, there were, you know, there were conversations about security and security.","startTime":"08:32","endTime":"08:37","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I'm not saying security is not important, but it wasn't the principal part of the threat model.","startTime":"08:37","endTime":"08:43","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it wasn't, you know, the adoption of containers was entirely tied to, you know, organizational changes, the rise of microservices, the explosion in the number of developers, repeatability, you know, understandability of your environment, you know, configuration as code, and all those things that were happening at the same time.","startTime":"08:43","endTime":"09:10","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that was the important thing.","startTime":"09:10","endTime":"09:12","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And none of that was captured in the containers versus vms.","startTime":"09:12","endTime":"09:16","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think there's a sort of.","startTime":"09:16","endTime":"09:18","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think there was a sort of alternate universe in which, you know, vms could have tried to be more competitive with containers and tried to adopt some of those processes.","startTime":"09:18","endTime":"09:31","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And you saw, I mean, and I kind of.","startTime":"09:32","endTime":"09:34","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I was.","startTime":"09:34","endTime":"09:35","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I was actually kind of interested in that.","startTime":"09:35","endTime":"09:37","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You know, over the years, we saw the little bits of that.","startTime":"09:37","endTime":"09:39","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You know, we had.","startTime":"09:41","endTime":"09:42","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"God, well, I've even forgotten where it's got the hashicorp tool for Packer.","startTime":"09:45","endTime":"09:49","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It was probably the earliest thing for creating VM environments.","startTime":"09:50","endTime":"09:53","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Repeatably.","startTime":"09:53","endTime":"09:54","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There were other tools since then, but that was very early on, like, okay, we want to do repeatability with vms.","startTime":"09:56","endTime":"10:04","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"How do we do it?","startTime":"10:04","endTime":"10:05","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I worked on Linux kit, which was shipped into Docker desktop, but that was also a way of repeatedly creating vms for running containers.","startTime":"10:07","endTime":"10:16","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But.","startTime":"10:16","endTime":"10:16","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then there was, you know, far cracker became like suddenly, oh, okay, lightweight.","startTime":"10:18","endTime":"10:24","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You can run really lightweight vms.","startTime":"10:24","endTime":"10:27","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean, again, there'd be more work.","startTime":"10:27","endTime":"10:28","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Before that, there was the whole CAta containers piece, like vms and kubernetes and things like that.","startTime":"10:28","endTime":"10:34","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So there was actually this whole kind of timeline where a whole bunch of people were trying to make vms more like containers.","startTime":"10:34","endTime":"10:39","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And arguably, you know, when you look at the services and the cloud providers run fargate and things, they are vms as containers, but they have a container API, not a VM API.","startTime":"10:39","endTime":"10:54","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So they're actually, they just went around the route of, well, containers are what people want, but they want the VM isolation.","startTime":"10:54","endTime":"11:05","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We'll make this hybrid, but it looks like from anyone's point of view, it is a container.","startTime":"11:05","endTime":"11:09","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then, like, it has all the important properties of container.","startTime":"11:10","endTime":"11:12","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's compatible with the container ecosystem, not the VM ecosystem.","startTime":"11:13","endTime":"11:16","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, I mean, to me, I think the reason why Docker won in a way over that was around more packaging for me was more like, you can pull a pre configured image.","startTime":"11:17","endTime":"11:29","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It became more like an application packaging more than.","startTime":"11:29","endTime":"11:32","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, no, absolutely.","startTime":"11:32","endTime":"11:33","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I think that's the thing.","startTime":"11:33","endTime":"11:34","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's what I mean, like that there is maybe a.","startTime":"11:34","endTime":"11:36","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There's maybe a path where vms went down that packaging route.","startTime":"11:37","endTime":"11:39","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"11:39","endTime":"11:40","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Nami kind of tried to do that.","startTime":"11:40","endTime":"11:42","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"11:42","endTime":"11:42","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And they had, I think if, you know, I think, as I said, like, there's a few of these routes towards that, but they didn't really.","startTime":"11:42","endTime":"11:50","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It never took off.","startTime":"11:50","endTime":"11:51","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And containers did, you know, very much to do a kind of reduction in complexity that made those things easier to understand because Vmsheen, you know, were just.","startTime":"11:51","endTime":"12:06","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Big, so much more surface area.","startTime":"12:06","endTime":"12:07","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"12:07","endTime":"12:07","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"12:07","endTime":"12:08","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And had, yeah.","startTime":"12:08","endTime":"12:09","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If you could take out a lot of the stuff just, and just simplify it down to the application piece, not the whole system piece.","startTime":"12:09","endTime":"12:18","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Now, I mean, again, there's kind of, we've had discussions about

Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But like, fundamentally, yeah, the idea was just, yeah, take the applications because that's simpler and that's also separation of concerns, whereas the VM, if

back.","startTime":"12:44","endTime":"12:46","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So back in 2019, some big changes had happened at Docker.","startTime":"12:46","endTime":"12:51","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"12:51","endTime":"12:51","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So the company was spun out into two.","startTime":"12:51","endTime":"12:54","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"One pot was sold and

light?","startTime":"12:57","endTime":"12:58","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because I think that's a bit of confusing story for people at large, what actually happened.","startTime":"12:58","endTime":"13:01","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Do you want to shed some light on what actually around that?","startTime":"13:01","endTime":"13:04","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"13:05","endTime":"13:05","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So, I mean, it's a complicated story in a way.","startTime":"13:05","endTime":"13:10","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, it goes back to, you know, goes back to a number of things, I think, first of all, you know, Docker Washington, explosively successful very quickly, and that in a way that very few open source projects or products ever are.","startTime":"13:10","endTime":"13:43","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that was difficult in many ways.","startTime":"13:43","endTime":"13:46","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It was such a success so fast, and it created this giant ecosystem around the cloud native ecosystem around it.","startTime":"13:48","endTime":"14:02","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And there was a huge amount of interest and money and investment in that area.","startTime":"14:02","endTime":"14:08","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I think that it was so unprecedented that having that huge ecosystem that it was very unclear for Docker, the company what the business that Docker should be in should be.","startTime":"14:09","endTime":"14:32","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And because everything was still really early and there was such a lot going on.","startTime":"14:33","endTime":"14:41","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The whole cloud native space was created from scratch pretty much over those years.","startTime":"14:42","endTime":"14:49","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so the business that Docker chose was, you know, I think I can see the reasons at the time, but it was like, it was kind of the, it seemed like the right thing at the time.","startTime":"14:50","endTime":"15:09","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it was basically our product was Docker Enterprise, which was, you know, a production side largely on prem, you know, run, you know, runtime production side product for Ops people.","startTime":"15:09","endTime":"15:26","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Docker Swarm, right.","startTime":"15:27","endTime":"15:28","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It was originally based on Docker Swarm.","startTime":"15:28","endTime":"15:30","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We migrated it to support Kubernetes and swarm, you know, so it was actually, it supported both.","startTime":"15:30","endTime":"15:38","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think there was a, that was another something we can talk about, like, internally later.","startTime":"15:39","endTime":"15:48","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think that.","startTime":"15:49","endTime":"15:50","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But, yeah, because it was a production orchestrator solution, but that market at the time was still quite small back in 2018 2019, because a lot of people were still trialing these things and not really running applications at scale back then.","startTime":"15:52","endTime":"16:20","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So a lot of customers, we talked to customers and they'd have a few applications that they would try on, even, as you say, or swarm, whatever, they own containers.","startTime":"16:20","endTime":"16:31","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They agreed it was a future, but they had a lot of work to do to get there.","startTime":"16:31","endTime":"16:34","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So the market size, relatively small, it was extremely competitive.","startTime":"16:34","endTime":"16:38","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Oh, yeah.","startTime":"16:39","endTime":"16:40","speaker_name":"Viktor

and stop them competing.","startTime":"16:56","endTime":"16:58","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, that's really disappointing, right.","startTime":"16:58","endTime":"16:59","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because I was.","startTime":"16:59","endTime":"17:00","speaker_name":"Viktor

back in those days, but then they just went to die at red hat.","startTime":"17:01","endTime":"17:05","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But, yeah, that's a different story.","startTime":"17:06","endTime":"17:07","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But there was a.","startTime":"17:07","endTime":"17:08","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There was.","startTime":"17:08","endTime":"17:08","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean, but that's the thing.","startTime":"17:09","endTime":"17:10","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, the market was too small to support the number of people there.","startTime":"17:10","endTime":"17:13","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I think there was another.","startTime":"17:13","endTime":"17:14","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There was another thing that I think, you know, and I didn't really, you know, so that was the kind of obvious competitive thing at the time.","startTime":"17:14","endTime":"17:20","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There was too many people in a too small a market.","startTime":"17:20","endTime":"17:23","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But the other thing I didn't really appreciate until a little later, I think, was that the early adopters who had made Docker a success and JSON Docker were not the people were selling to.","startTime":"17:23","endTime":"17:43","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They were not running on Prem.","startTime":"17:43","endTime":"17:46","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They were the people who'd gone into the cloud early as well, because containers in the cloud were part of the same thing, the whole cloud native thing.","startTime":"17:47","endTime":"17:56","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"All our early adopters were early cloud adopters.","startTime":"17:57","endTime":"18:00","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so the people were selling to who wanted on prem often actually weren't even using Docker at the time.","startTime":"18:01","endTime":"18:07","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We were trying to sell it.","startTime":"18:07","endTime":"18:07","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I remember having a meeting with one bank, and there was a lot of these meetings back then, and they'd taken a year to sign an evaluation agreement.","startTime":"18:07","endTime":"18:23","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They were going to try it out.","startTime":"18:24","endTime":"18:25","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"This was a very slow sales cycle.","startTime":"18:25","endTime":"18:27","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"A lot of the time they were also coming and saying, we've heard about this Docker thing, it's amazing.","startTime":"18:27","endTime":"18:32","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And this was great.","startTime":"18:32","endTime":"18:33","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We were a small startup that could sell to have these sales conversations with big companies, but they didn't use Docker, but they believed it was a magic thing that they could sprinkle on their terrible systems to make things better, but they weren't using it, whereas there were all these people who were using Docker.","startTime":"18:33","endTime":"18:57","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And were being very successful with Docker, but weren't.","startTime":"18:57","endTime":"19:00","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We weren't actually.","startTime":"19:00","endTime":"19:01","speaker_name":"Justin

Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"19:03","endTime":"19:03","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But, yeah, the thing with, the thing does this was like, Docker was used by everybody, but nobody paying Docker.","startTime":"19:04","endTime":"19:10","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"19:10","endTime":"19:11","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That was like, very successful in that sense, but not.","startTime":"19:11","endTime":"19:14","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, like you're saying, like, not the people actually pay for it.","startTime":"19:14","endTime":"19:17","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"19:17","endTime":"19:17","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But I think so, you know, when.","startTime":"19:17","endTime":"19:19","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we sold the.","startTime":"19:19","endTime":"19:20","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we sold that Docker enterprise business to Marantis because, and I think, you know, Marantis was originally big on OpenStack.","startTime":"19:21","endTime":"19:31","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They had a big Openstack customer base, but they could see the writing on the wall with kubernetes.","startTime":"19:31","endTime":"19:36","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They'd been trying to build their own kubernetes solution, I think, gradually, but acquiring ours accelerated them.","startTime":"19:36","endTime":"19:46","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think they, you know, they did quite well out of their business in the air.","startTime":"19:46","endTime":"19:52","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It took them a while, but that's still.","startTime":"19:52","endTime":"19:57","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They grew the business.","startTime":"20:00","endTime":"20:01","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It took time and patience, but they had the customer base, particularly telcos was their core market, where they knew the customers well.","startTime":"20:01","endTime":"20:17","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They already were in with them on OpenStack, and they could introduce kubernetes on top of OpenStack to them.","startTime":"20:17","endTime":"20:24","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so it kind of made sense from that point of view.","startTime":"20:24","endTime":"20:28","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And we, you know, we kind of, were kind of left with this, with the other bits of the business in a way that, but with a strong desire to focus on those original customers who had made Docker successful.","startTime":"20:28","endTime":"20:49","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So Docker Hub stayed inside of this new entity, right?","startTime":"20:51","endTime":"20:55","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, so we had basically had Docker hub, Docker desktop, the open source Docker engine composer.","startTime":"20:55","endTime":"21:07","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that was kind of, you know, that's basically what we kind of started with.","startTime":"21:08","endTime":"21:14","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so, but we, yeah, so we had a clear desire to go back to the original customers who'd made Docker successful and who were using Docker in the cloud and also to go back, you know, to work with developers rather than just the ops side of things.","startTime":"21:14","endTime":"21:36","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because, again, the ops side of things was by, you know, by then being dominated by the cloud providers.","startTime":"21:36","endTime":"21:44","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We didn't want to do the on prem thing because we recognized that the cloud was, you know, very tied to the success of containerization and those things.","startTime":"21:44","endTime":"21:55","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we, so that's why we refocused on the developer market and on the, on people using, primarily using the cloud.","startTime":"21:55","endTime":"22:06","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Not all the customers using the cloud, but most of them.","startTime":"22:06","endTime":"22:09","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"When you talk to them, a lot of people have a very strong tie between containerization and the cloud.","startTime":"22:09","endTime":"22:15","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"These journeys go together for them sometimes they're incentivizing people.","startTime":"22:16","endTime":"22:24","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You have to move to the cloud, but you also have to use Docker containerized to do that.","startTime":"22:26","endTime":"22:30","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And because we don't want to just lift and shift to the cloud, because that's not going to give us the value.","startTime":"22:30","endTime":"22:35","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We want to do the whole cloud native route.","startTime":"22:35","endTime":"22:38","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so we very much didn't want to be in this kind of world where we're tied to this kind of on prem only and just separated from the cloud.","startTime":"22:38","endTime":"22:53","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I think that, you know, when I look like, again, when it's coming, kind of coming back to the conversation about containers versus vms, again, like, that wasn't the question.","startTime":"22:54","endTime":"23:03","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The things that all grew up together were the cloud, the organizational changes, the kind of, you know, the stuff that the team topologies work and the kind of like, how should we work together?","startTime":"23:06","endTime":"23:19","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"How should we, you know, how should we build applications now we have hundreds of developers, nothing.","startTime":"23:20","endTime":"23:25","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Three.","startTime":"23:25","endTime":"23:25","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"How do we have understandable things that people can work with that are repeatable and they can understand, you know, they can under, you know, we reduce the kind of complexity burden that people have to understand the whole kind of piece around.","startTime":"23:28","endTime":"23:44","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean, I kind of, looking back, I kind of think that, you know, when you, when we, when you introduce something radical, like darker, you've got to, you have a sort of change budget where you can change some things about how people work, but not too much containers, unlike, say, serverless, you didn't have to rewrite your applications.","startTime":"23:44","endTime":"24:08","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You could just take your applications exactly as they were.","startTime":"24:08","endTime":"24:12","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But we insisted on two things roughly, neither of which were really forced by the technology they would, but they kind of, we managed to bring people along, I think one of which, as you mentioned before, is one thing perk and one process per container.","startTime":"24:12","endTime":"24:30","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"24:30","endTime":"24:31","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Again, people, some people know that you can run a process supervisor and run multiple things in a container, but when.","startTime":"24:31","endTime":"24:39","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You introduce Ssh into a container, that's where, you know, you can't miss the boat.","startTime":"24:39","endTime":"24:42","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, yeah, totally.","startTime":"24:42","endTime":"24:43","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean, but, you know, it's possible, but I.","startTime":"24:44","endTime":"24:47","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That separation really helps modulize things, and it also fits the microservices thing.","startTime":"24:47","endTime":"24:54","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And the other one was, you have to redeploy a container, you can't update it in place.","startTime":"24:54","endTime":"24:59","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That was really the radical one because that suddenly allowed you to understand that the thing that you built was exactly the same thing in production.","startTime":"25:00","endTime":"25:08","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Being able to track that content hash all the way through the life cycle and be able to know, like, you know, Thursday last week, it was this version that was in

whole IIC, it really took a while to get behind it mentally, I think.","startTime":"26:50","endTime":"27:18","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, because I worked for

that.","startTime":"49:22","endTime":"49:24","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"One of the kind of design things about how people were managing, you know, understanding vulnerabilities was, you know, and we.","startTime":"49:27","endTime":"49:37","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You know, we used to do this with the services we had on Docker, things like that.","startTime":"49:37","endTime":"49:40","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It was like you would.","startTime":"49:40","endTime":"49:41","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You would take an image, scan it, look at vulnerabilities, and give the user reports on that.","startTime":"49:41","endTime":"49:46","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But we really wanted to separate out the two stages of creating an SBA on what's in the image versus the bit about, is there a vulnerability?","startTime":"49:47","endTime":"49:59","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because if you separate those, that lets you actually scout is basically a real time database with live feeds from different sources.","startTime":"49:59","endTime":"50:12","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"As soon as a vulnerability happens, you can get an alert about it without having to run the image through a pipeline again, to find that.","startTime":"50:12","endTime":"50:20","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because we link the vulnerability to the SBom item that we've indexed in the database, and we say, okay, these images now, as of a minute ago, now have a vulnerability, and then we can look and see if they in production.","startTime":"50:20","endTime":"50:37","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Are they things that you're actively using?","startTime":"50:38","endTime":"50:40","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then we can help you remediate that.","startTime":"50:40","endTime":"50:42","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it's like separating out what's in it and is there a problem about what's in it?","startTime":"50:42","endTime":"50:51","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Pieces.","startTime":"50:51","endTime":"50:52","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And running them separately allows this real kind of much more responsive tooling.","startTime":"50:52","endTime":"51:01","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So, to talk to me, you do some interesting stuff with, I guess, at the station and embedding s bombs in kind of metadata.","startTime":"51:01","endTime":"51:09","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I believe that's stored in the OCI as part of the image.","startTime":"51:09","endTime":"51:12","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"51:12","endTime":"51:12","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Is that correct assumption or.","startTime":"51:12","endTime":"51:14","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I haven't actually done a deep dive on this.","startTime":"51:14","endTime":"51:16","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, I mean, I think that, I mean we actually, scale supports a lot of different formats as well, but yeah, we've been working on doing that because, you know, because we actually, you know, we maintain build kit, which is what the majority of people are using for doing builds.","startTime":"51:16","endTime":"51:43","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That means that we can, if we can add these s bombs at build time and then carry them, you know, all the way through, then we can, you know, then we can use that to index.","startTime":"51:43","endTime":"51:56","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So rather than, you know, if you add the s bomb at build time with buildkit, then we don't need to scan the image at all.","startTime":"51:56","endTime":"52:04","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We can just read the s bomb.","startTime":"52:04","endTime":"52:05","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And we feel that having it attached to the image is helpful because it, I mean, I think that there's been discussion, you know, there's different models because, you know, six door effectively lets you attach it externally in the transparency log.","startTime":"52:07","endTime":"52:28","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But that's kind of, there's a lot of use cases where it's actually more effective, easier for people to deal with if it's on the index.","startTime":"52:28","endTime":"52:36","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like if you're in a air gapped environment where you don't want to reach out to an external thing.","startTime":"52:36","endTime":"52:41","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And to be honest, and like the transparency log is not a high performance database either.","startTime":"52:42","endTime":"52:46","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so, but we don't actually, like, we actually index that in the scout database for fast access again.","startTime":"52:47","endTime":"52:57","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that, because again we actually want to be able to alert you when there's a vulnerability change on something.","startTime":"52:57","endTime":"53:03","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we still want to maintain a copy of that in the database, but it's a copy and the source of truth is what you add to the image, what you put in the image.","startTime":"53:03","endTime":"53:13","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you can manage the s bom if you want.","startTime":"53:13","endTime":"53:19","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You can use whatever tooling you want to construct the s bom that you attach to the image.","startTime":"53:19","endTime":"53:25","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you can be sure that, because I think part of the reason for doing s bombs at build time rather than by scanning is actually quite hard to retroactively work out what was used to build something after the tooling there has gone better in many cases, but it's still like, you know that at build time you've got the complete information about what went into it because it's all there to build it with.","startTime":"53:25","endTime":"53:50","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And you can often you have even more information like what were the build tools, what were the internal build stages and the tools that even if they don't appear in the output they could potentially affect the output.","startTime":"53:50","endTime":"54:08","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like if you have a compiler bug, you need to know which version the compiler is even though the compiler is not necessarily linked into the final image.","startTime":"54:08","endTime":"54:14","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Although often like tools I go will put metadata about what the compiler version actually was in there.","startTime":"54:14","endTime":"54:21","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Not every language tooling will do that.","startTime":"54:22","endTime":"54:24","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And traditional C tooling doesn't put any metadata about the compiler version in there.","startTime":"54:24","endTime":"54:30","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Sboms and clay is a whole different kind of word in general.","startTime":"54:30","endTime":"54:34","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"54:34","endTime":"54:34","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean, but I think that like, you know, so having, creating sboms at build time gives you that complete control where you can just take the image, you can take the data from the actual build tooling and the, and feed it straight into the SBom directly rather than trying to reverse engineer out of what came out of the container image.","startTime":"54:35","endTime":"54:55","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So and then if you attach it then, you know, the information is there.","startTime":"54:55","endTime":"55:02","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So then you can feed it through any tooling.","startTime":"55:02","endTime":"55:04","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And there's a broader kind of, you know, there's a broader, you know, this is broader attestation projects around, particularly around in toto which is a CNCF project which is really around, you know, it's a project around attaching build process attestations in the broadest sense, not just s bombs.","startTime":"55:04","endTime":"55:25","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"How was this built?","startTime":"55:25","endTime":"55:26","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Who built it, where did they build it?","startTime":"55:27","endTime":"55:29","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so there's a lot of you can add that metadata like this was built in Docker's AWS account.","startTime":"55:30","endTime":"55:39","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So, you know, we can take the assession from that, from the metadata that Amazon provides.","startTime":"55:39","endTime":"55:48","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You can get it, you can get a sign, you can get assigned signature from Amazon saying that this payload was built, this boot time payload was in AWS at this point and things like that.","startTime":"55:48","endTime":"56:01","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So there's a lot more data that you can really get.","startTime":"56:01","endTime":"56:04","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"A reproducible thing that gives you more information that gives you certainty about, you know, how the build process happened, where it happened, what happened and so on and that type of information, I think.","startTime":"56:04","endTime":"56:20","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And again, the GitHub assertion from GitHub actions.","startTime":"56:21","endTime":"56:25","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, I was going to say, yeah.","startTime":"56:26","endTime":"56:27","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So all those kinds of things together give you this whole question of things that give you more certainty.","startTime":"56:27","endTime":"56:34","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I think that our view is generally that bundling all that together in the OCI format is useful so that it's all self contained technically from the kind of the statements are about hashes and don't have to be bundled, but the bundling convenient to keep things together.","startTime":"56:34","endTime":"56:56","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that's what the sort of extensibility of the ACI format was kind of designed for.","startTime":"56:57","endTime":"57:04","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And if you look at any of the official builds in Hub today, do they all have this included as metadata to all those images or is this just you can use as your toolchain?","startTime":"57:05","endTime":"57:18","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We're rolling it out.","startTime":"57:18","endTime":"57:20","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's not, I think, on all of them yet, but it's on a lot of them now.","startTime":"57:20","endTime":"57:23","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it's kind of in, you know, we're kind of going through this process and being our first customer, zero for ourselves.","startTime":"57:23","endTime":"57:33","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean, I was very insistent when we're doing this that like, if it doesn't work for us, then yeah, it's not good enough for other people.","startTime":"57:33","endTime":"57:41","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean, our use cases is kind of complicated, but I mean, I think that, you know, if there are, if you can't validate the attestations on Docker official images, and use them, then that's not working for people, I think because I did a talk about this many years ago in Kubecon about how, you know, with the earlier work we did like no one in practice was validating the success signatures we put on Docker official images.","startTime":"57:41","endTime":"58:10","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So because it was very hard to, and it's difficult, and you kind of see this with the adoption of HTTPs, it's hard to incrementally go from an ecosystem that doesn't have signing and security checks to one that does in a way that doesn't leave holes where, because lots of stuff is unvalidatable.","startTime":"58:10","endTime":"58:35","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so you kind of tend to be in this position where you tend to fall back to, oh, if it doesn't, you know, you can fall back to oh, we don't have to validate it because it must be part of the unvalidatable set.","startTime":"58:35","endTime":"58:47","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And trying to get to a point where you carve out things, sets of things that are known to be validatable and therefore you should validate them.","startTime":"58:47","endTime":"58:56","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You know, it's a kind of slow process movingly because it's a to that.","startTime":"58:56","endTime":"59:01","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so I think we're still kind of on that journey to where everything is validatable in the cloud native ecosystem.","startTime":"59:02","endTime":"59:14","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But it's just, it is just a hard path going from there.","startTime":"59:14","endTime":"59:20","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's kind of weird when you look at it like there was a whole like Docker images in the earliest release all had signatures on them, but the signatures were kind of useless unless they're still there in the v one format.","startTime":"59:22","endTime":"59:37","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But they were kind of, they kind of, they were used to signatures or just hashes.","startTime":"59:37","endTime":"59:41","speaker_name":"Justin

users.","startTime":"59:55","endTime":"01:00:00","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it was kind of, they weren't actually much use right then, but then they weren't

that wasm has the same thing, that there's a lot of different use cases and they're, and they're kind of pushing in slightly different directions, but they are, they're using a set of common tooling

a bit of JavaScript.","startTime":"01:19:08","endTime":"01:19:12","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There was actually a, like a really radical proposal have an index wasm,

bunch of, but in principle I think, yeah, you could, and I think the rust community are kind of pushing that direction most because they're quite, most of the WASM communities here are rust people and

few years ago that you can write wasm in any language you like as long as it's rast.","startTime":"01:20:34","endTime":"01:20:41","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But it

over.","startTime":"01:24:04","endTime":"01:24:05","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, but I mean I think that like that, but there's, but it's actually very, like, it's actually the ecosystems are quite diverged and there are, I mean, although there are, you know, there is a community of people trying to do things that support, or rather support, you know, there's people who are supporting the web APIs on server side or on which, like for example, actually cloudflare workers is a great example of that where their core APIs are the browser APIs.","startTime":"01:24:05","endTime":"01:24:42","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so you can mostly write browser code that works there.","startTime":"01:24:42","endTime":"01:24:45","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But again, even like there's still things that they have that are, you know, because the environment is different from the browser.","startTime":"01:24:45","endTime":"01:24:54","speaker_name":"Justin Cormack","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The biggest one has always been like inbound
