of a tool that I would be very surprised if not every single guest on the.","startTime":"00:17","endTime":"00:25","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Every.","startTime":"00:25","endTime":"00:25","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Sorry, every single viewer of this podcast has used in one capacity or another.","startTime":"00:25","endTime":"00:29","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Which is curlae.","startTime":"00:30","endTime":"00:31","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Exactly.","startTime":"00:32","endTime":"00:32","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"00:32","endTime":"00:33","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And for those, surprisingly, who have never heard of Curl, how would you describe Curl?","startTime":"00:33","endTime":"00:39","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I always struggled with how to describe it because Curl is a command line tool that just does Internet transfers, uploads and downloads specified as a URL.","startTime":"00:41","endTime":"00:51","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And of course, it supports 28 different URL schemes or protocols.","startTime":"00:51","endTime":"00:57","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Well, that's what Curl is, the tool.","startTime":"00:59","endTime":"01:01","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Then, of course it has a library to libcurl, which is usually the thing that gets me to cover more installations everywhere because that's a component used by a lot of others.","startTime":"01:01","endTime":"01:13","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it's running in a lot of places doing Internet transfers for the world.","startTime":"01:13","endTime":"01:19","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Really?","startTime":"01:19","endTime":"01:20","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"01:20","endTime":"01:21","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I would describe Cross as one of the most amazing swiss army knife tools for the command line.","startTime":"01:21","endTime":"01:26","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That is a tool that I use religiously myself and I love it.","startTime":"01:26","endTime":"01:30","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So, yeah, thank you for creating such a great tooling.","startTime":"01:30","endTime":"01:33","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I want to talk a lot about Curl, but before we do that, I kind of want to talk about your early days because I think there's a lot of similarity with people who have a similar track record as yours that have been amazing engineers over the years.","startTime":"01:35","endTime":"01:50","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And your engineering background really started in the Amiga world.","startTime":"01:50","endTime":"01:54","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"01:54","endTime":"01:54","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then the demo scene.","startTime":"01:54","endTime":"01:55","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So maybe, Phil, people about your background, like how you ended up on this.","startTime":"01:55","endTime":"02:00","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Track really well, I started with the Commodore 64.","startTime":"02:00","endTime":"02:03","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Oh, the C 64.","startTime":"02:03","endTime":"02:04","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Oh, right before them, yeah.","startTime":"02:04","endTime":"02:06","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So, yeah, the Commodore 64 was really the computer that got me interested and sort of fascinated by programming and computers in general because, well, I had.","startTime":"02:06","endTime":"02:21","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I had a friend there in my school, so I sort of got the taste for it and we gathered it at his place and, you know, entered programs from those early computer magazines, you know, with those data things.","startTime":"02:21","endTime":"02:35","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You had to type it in from a magazine.","startTime":"02:35","endTime":"02:37","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Took forever.","startTime":"02:37","endTime":"02:38","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then it was wrong in the end, but you didn't quite have any linting then.","startTime":"02:38","endTime":"02:43","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Well, some of them had some checksum, so you knew that it was wrong, but some of them didn't.","startTime":"02:44","endTime":"02:49","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It was just ended up just one of those numbers was wrong somewhere in all of that.","startTime":"02:49","endTime":"02:54","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Well, so anyway, that got me sort of into it.","startTime":"02:54","endTime":"02:57","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then me and my little brother, we bought Commodore 64 in 1985 and that.","startTime":"02:57","endTime":"03:05","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then I actually, I was interested in programming pretty much from the beginning, not that I could, but, you know, I.","startTime":"03:06","endTime":"03:12","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Back then, they shipped with manual somehow basic was built in.","startTime":"03:12","endTime":"03:16","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There were some basic manuals how to do that so you could start making some, you know, guess the number programs or really silly basic things.","startTime":"03:16","endTime":"03:24","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But yeah, that got me into that.","startTime":"03:24","endTime":"03:27","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And very soon, well, my friend angel who had the computer before me, he and I started, well, look at, there's this thing called demos.","startTime":"03:27","endTime":"03:39","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"People are doing how, you know, flying things, music and colors and stuff, and how do you do that, actually?","startTime":"03:39","endTime":"03:45","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Oh, right, there's something called assembly.","startTime":"03:45","endTime":"03:47","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You have to write assembler to do that.","startTime":"03:47","endTime":"03:49","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What's that?","startTime":"03:49","endTime":"03:50","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then we just got into that.","startTime":"03:50","endTime":"03:53","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then we got into that demo scene on the Commodore 64, and we made a lot of demos, created a demo group, and worked on that crazy amount of time for several years, actually.","startTime":"03:53","endTime":"04:05","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, I mean, I remember SFL sweet Dreamhack back in the days when Dreamhack was actually mostly demo scene in the early days, and they were filling up arenas with this 64K demos and, I mean, it's amazing.","startTime":"04:06","endTime":"04:21","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And the amount of super high caliber engineers coming out of that scene is just fantastic.","startTime":"04:21","endTime":"04:29","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right?","startTime":"04:29","endTime":"04:29","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, yeah.","startTime":"04:30","endTime":"04:31","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It was a really good school and a community and everything, so you pushed yourself to sort of try to show off, but you also learned tricks and how to do that, and it was a really good way to get into computers.","startTime":"04:31","endTime":"04:43","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I really sort of attribute a lot of what I know and my interest in to those early days when I learned exactly how to, how everything like that worked, how to write assembly.","startTime":"04:43","endTime":"04:53","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You know, you get a different sense of what memory is on how computers work when you actually write assembly.","startTime":"04:54","endTime":"04:59","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Exactly.","startTime":"04:59","endTime":"04:59","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Instruction by instruction and assembly on those early day computers and eight bit things, they were.","startTime":"04:59","endTime":"05:05","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean, it wasn't easy, maybe, but comparison to modern computers, they were easy.","startTime":"05:05","endTime":"05:10","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So learning assembly one of those more stupid devices is actually a pretty good way to learn assembly, because things were easier.","startTime":"05:10","endTime":"05:17","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You could, you know, you could actually count how many cycles a program would take because you knew how many cycles each instruction would take and so on.","startTime":"05:17","endTime":"05:25","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"05:26","endTime":"05:26","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I had even Upton on the podcast a few episodes ago, and we talked about, I guess, the lack of people.","startTime":"05:26","endTime":"05:34","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I mean, that was the original of the raspberry PI, right?","startTime":"05:34","endTime":"05:36","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Is that he found that there were very few people that actually understood that level or that low level of engineering that the C 64 and the like, symbols, computers in the same cohort really fostered.","startTime":"05:36","endTime":"05:50","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so I think it's.","startTime":"05:50","endTime":"05:51","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I'm glad to see that there are new tools that kind of addresses that because we had an era.","startTime":"05:52","endTime":"05:56","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Well, everything was high level and nobody really understood what actually happened under hood.","startTime":"05:56","endTime":"06:01","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right, right.","startTime":"06:01","endTime":"06:02","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So.","startTime":"06:03","endTime":"06:04","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then obviously that led into the BBS era, which I guess you ran a BBS as well in those days, right?","startTime":"06:04","endTime":"06:10","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yes, I did.","startTime":"06:11","endTime":"06:15","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Or did together with my brother.","startTime":"06:15","endTime":"06:16","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And we wrote our own BBS software there too, because why not?","startTime":"06:16","endTime":"06:19","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So, yeah, it was fun.","startTime":"06:19","endTime":"06:22","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It was a fun era of early communication and message boards and stuff.","startTime":"06:23","endTime":"06:28","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And a little bit like what we would later learn, the Internet could be like communicating and discussing things with people in a greater sense than just the little you and your closest friends.","startTime":"06:28","endTime":"06:44","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So, yeah, that was great fun.","startTime":"06:44","endTime":"06:45","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then because I switched from the Commodore 64 and then I started to working on the Amiga and Amiga suddenly was not as fun to do demos on because, I don't know, when I did demos on the Commodore 64, it felt like a small little sandbox.","startTime":"06:46","endTime":"07:02","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Everything had some sort of borders.","startTime":"07:02","endTime":"07:03","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It was hard because it was small and tiny.","startTime":"07:03","endTime":"07:05","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You had to sort of squeeze in things to maximize.","startTime":"07:05","endTime":"07:08","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then it.","startTime":"07:08","endTime":"07:09","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It felt like when going to the Amiga, everything was completely.","startTime":"07:09","endTime":"07:12","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Well, it felt like that, well, everything is possible on this based, you know, sixty eight k, eight megahertz.","startTime":"07:12","endTime":"07:20","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"This is what a monster.","startTime":"07:20","endTime":"07:21","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it felt like, okay, and completely different assembly.","startTime":"07:22","endTime":"07:24","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It was 68k instead of the 6502.","startTime":"07:24","endTime":"07:27","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it wasn't really that fun to do demos.","startTime":"07:27","endTime":"07:30","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So me and my friend, then we started let's do a text editor, because we thought that existing text editors were not as good as they could be.","startTime":"07:30","endTime":"07:37","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So why not make text editor?","startTime":"07:37","endTime":"07:39","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And at the same point in time, basically I started working at IBM.","startTime":"07:39","endTime":"07:45","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And at IBM I got into contact with AIX, the IBM Unix version, on Rs 6000 machines.","startTime":"07:45","endTime":"07:55","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And on those we ran emacs.","startTime":"07:55","endTime":"07:58","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that sort of opened up my eyes for, wait a minute, emacs where everything is sort of programmable in lispenness.","startTime":"07:58","endTime":"08:04","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I didn't really like Lisp, but I figured, well, this is sort of.","startTime":"08:05","endTime":"08:08","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I got a lot of inspiration for our text editor.","startTime":"08:08","endTime":"08:10","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We called Freqsad from Emacs at work, then worked on that on Amiga at home.","startTime":"08:10","endTime":"08:16","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then eventually I transitioned into working on Unix directly instead of doing on.","startTime":"08:17","endTime":"08:25","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I just dropped the Amiga thing and went into working on Unix machines.","startTime":"08:25","endTime":"08:31","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I think that has probably come in very handy now as the array of supported devices for Curl is insane.","startTime":"08:32","endTime":"08:40","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Almost.","startTime":"08:40","endTime":"08:40","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The breath is insane.","startTime":"08:41","endTime":"08:43","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yes, it is.","startTime":"08:44","endTime":"08:46","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's super crazy, actually.","startTime":"08:46","endTime":"08:48","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What's the strangest architecture you've had to port to curl, I guess Libcurl, more so than curl I would imagine.","startTime":"08:48","endTime":"08:55","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Actually.","startTime":"08:56","endTime":"08:57","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"it's not that, well, there are, they're really not that strange when it comes to Libcurl because Libcurl is very low level.","startTime":"08:58","endTime":"09:06","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It basically only runs on top of a TCP IP stack.","startTime":"09:06","endTime":"09:09","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And the POSIX style API that was made, I don't know when in this, I don't exactly, I don't know my history there, but it was founded long before I started this.","startTime":"09:09","endTime":"09:21","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"70 something.","startTime":"09:21","endTime":"09:22","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, exactly.","startTime":"09:22","endTime":"09:23","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So mostly all operating systems offer a very POSiX style, like almost at least for doing networking.","startTime":"09:23","endTime":"09:32","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So usually it's very easy.","startTime":"09:32","endTime":"09:36","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So usually there's just some quirks here and there include files and exceptions and tiny things.","startTime":"09:36","endTime":"09:44","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So usually I haven't.","startTime":"09:44","endTime":"09:46","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I used to say that because I truly think so, that windows is actually the most quirky operating system to work with because that's the single operating system that is the most different to all the others and yet has a lot of users.","startTime":"09:46","endTime":"10:00","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it's still a relevant one.","startTime":"10:00","endTime":"10:01","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we still have to make it work.","startTime":"10:01","endTime":"10:02","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But that's actually the one I think I struggle the most with, possibly also because I'm not really a windows guy, so I don't really know all that sort of.","startTime":"10:02","endTime":"10:10","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"For me it's always an uphill battle to work on the things there.","startTime":"10:11","endTime":"10:16","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So otherwise almost everything else is more streamlined around whole six API and how to do things.","startTime":"10:16","endTime":"10:24","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Fair enough, fair enough.","startTime":"10:25","endTime":"10:26","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So let's talk a bit about obviously building and maintaining curl because that's obviously, it's a beast of a project in the sense of not only complexity, but also like community.","startTime":"10:27","endTime":"10:37","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because you have obviously maintained this for why is it 15 years or whatever it is, you have maintained it now.","startTime":"10:37","endTime":"10:44","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Which is not trivial, for 26 years at least.","startTime":"10:44","endTime":"10:48","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Oh wow.","startTime":"10:48","endTime":"10:49","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"10:49","endTime":"10:49","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, so I'm fully off of my research here.","startTime":"10:49","endTime":"10:51","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Building and maintaining a healthy community is in the open source world, obviously.","startTime":"10:53","endTime":"10:59","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I guess GitHub made it easier and harder simultaneously as we moved away from mailing lists and whatnot.","startTime":"10:59","endTime":"11:05","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"11:05","endTime":"11:06","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What have you found?","startTime":"11:06","endTime":"11:07","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like dealing and maintaining a healthy community?","startTime":"11:07","endTime":"11:11","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I'm curious about your insights on that because that's.","startTime":"11:11","endTime":"11:13","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I would, I think curl is regarded as a very healthy ecosystem compared to what many other projects.","startTime":"11:13","endTime":"11:19","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Well, for example, I think, yeah, I worked really hard to make sure that we reduce friction and make it as easy as possible for anyone and everyone to participate.","startTime":"11:20","endTime":"11:31","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's one of the reasons I still argue in favor of GitHub, even though there are reasons to be against it.","startTime":"11:32","endTime":"11:40","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But the fact that so many people are already on the platform, they already know how to work on the platform and how to do things on the platform, like how to make a fork and make a pull request.","startTime":"11:40","endTime":"11:53","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If you just go with that concept, you lower the bar quite a lot for so many users.","startTime":"11:54","endTime":"12:01","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I want it to be like that.","startTime":"12:02","endTime":"12:04","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I want it to be easy and possible for anyone to fix whatever problem you find.","startTime":"12:04","endTime":"12:07","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If you find a typo in the documentation, I want it to be simple for someone to just fix that typo and send it to me.","startTime":"12:08","endTime":"12:14","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I don't want it to be any obstacles or bureaucracy or anything in the way to do that or for me to accept those changes.","startTime":"12:14","endTime":"12:21","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that's the goal here, to make sure that everything is streamlined for those who want to participate.","startTime":"12:21","endTime":"12:27","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then of course make it possible for people to do changes again, not just that single type at once.","startTime":"12:28","endTime":"12:34","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"12:34","endTime":"12:34","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But when you've dipped your toe in the water, sort of make it possible for them to, hey, grab the next issue or help answer a question or join in the team.","startTime":"12:34","endTime":"12:43","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But also I should call it sort of, we don't have any, there's no steps in the ladder.","startTime":"12:43","endTime":"12:51","speaker_name":"Daniel

anyway.","startTime":"23:08","endTime":"23:11","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There's no upside.","startTime":"23:11","endTime":"23:12","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I collect them on my site now and I have a collection of my funniest emails nowadays.","startTime":"23:13","endTime":"23:18","speaker_name":"Daniel

that's.","startTime":"23:20","endTime":"23:21","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That must be it.","startTime":"23:21","endTime":"23:21","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What?","startTime":"23:22","endTime":"23:22","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I mean, what's the amount of emails you get per day for that?","startTime":"23:22","endTime":"23:25","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I mean, is that crazy or are they.","startTime":"23:25","endTime":"23:28","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, no, it's not crazy.","startTime":"23:28","endTime":"23:30","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So actually, it's not even one a day.","startTime":"23:30","endTime":"23:34","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it's more like one strange email.","startTime":"23:34","endTime":"23:37","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Well, most of them are not fun at all.","startTime":"23:38","endTime":"23:42","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Most of them are just confused and then I just don't care about them.","startTime":"23:42","endTime":"23:45","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Some of them are slightly amusing or scary, but there's more like a few per month maybe.","startTime":"23:45","endTime":"23:51","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it's really not a load of any sort.","startTime":"23:51","endTime":"23:54","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"All right, that's fair.","startTime":"23:54","endTime":"23:55","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"All right, let's go back to curl for a bit.","startTime":"23:55","endTime":"23:58","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I was really curious about a few things about this, and one of them is the future roadmap I had.","startTime":"23:58","endTime":"24:04","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And in terms in particular, let's focus on, well, the standards moving forward.","startTime":"24:04","endTime":"24:10","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I was chatting with some friends before I hopped on this, and one of the people asked me, like, how do you assess which standards you want to adopt in curl?","startTime":"24:10","endTime":"24:18","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Is that driven by user demand or is it driven by you?","startTime":"24:18","endTime":"24:23","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Seeing the future of, like, this is really interesting.","startTime":"24:23","endTime":"24:25","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think this has weight, or how.","startTime":"24:25","endTime":"24:27","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Do you see that it's driven by all of that and the rolling of a dice, basically.","startTime":"24:27","endTime":"24:33","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it depends.","startTime":"24:33","endTime":"24:35","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So yeah, I try to follow, for example, since curl is used for Internet transfers on the Internet, and a lot of curl use is like mimicking what a browser can do.","startTime":"24:36","endTime":"24:52","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So instead of doing it with a browser, you can automate it with curl.","startTime":"24:52","endTime":"24:56","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that's one reason to make sure that almost everything you can do with a browser, I want it to be possible to do with curl.","startTime":"24:56","endTime":"25:03","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"25:03","endTime":"25:03","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So if the browser suddenly adopts something new, crazy fun something, then usually we also go that route because then we know that it's going to be the new thing by a lot of users on the Internet or the web.","startTime":"25:03","endTime":"25:20","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So typically things that are adopted by all the browsers, we also do some of those things.","startTime":"25:20","endTime":"25:27","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You can figure that out pretty early on that, you know, and all the browsers are on the train, they're going in that direction.","startTime":"25:27","endTime":"25:33","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Of course we are going to implement that as well.","startTime":"25:33","endTime":"25:35","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like the HTTP versions, right?","startTime":"25:35","endTime":"25:37","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"All the big ones are going to adopt the new HTTP version, so it's not a bad bet that we are going to do that as well.","startTime":"25:37","endTime":"25:45","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I guess you're constraining that to ones that are official standards.","startTime":"25:45","endTime":"25:51","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So, I mean, chrome is kind of playing a bit rough and dirty here and invent standards themselves a bit.","startTime":"25:51","endTime":"25:56","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I guess.","startTime":"25:56","endTime":"25:57","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"25:57","endTime":"25:57","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I don't want to go sort of on a tangent on doing silly things either.","startTime":"25:57","endTime":"26:03","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So, no, I want them to be real standards and with a sort of with a goal or sort of with a future that we think that people will use.","startTime":"26:03","endTime":"26:17","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But of course that's hard to know.","startTime":"26:18","endTime":"26:20","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And also I kind of enjoy being sort of early on the train as well, so that we can help out to, like, I've been early on HTTP two, I've been fairly early on HP three, so that we get a tool to start also testing out the versions fairly early, perhaps even during the protocol development, so we can get some stuff early on and try it out and see does this actually work in reality?","startTime":"26:20","endTime":"26:45","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that's kind of fun, even if it also means that sometimes it's a lot of effort that we don't have to backpedal and do something differently because standards change and so on.","startTime":"26:45","endTime":"26:54","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, I can imagine.","startTime":"26:54","endTime":"26:56","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So it really matters on a personal interest and who wants this.","startTime":"26:56","endTime":"27:01","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And if companies show up and say, hey, we want to do this and someone pays for that development, that's also of course a strong motivator to go push for that because some things, if there's no company supporting stuff and it's a huge effort, then maybe we just, yeah, we might want it, but maybe it's too big an effort for us to just do it ourselves.","startTime":"27:01","endTime":"27:23","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we just wait and sell and see.","startTime":"27:23","endTime":"27:25","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, because you're also building tech debt in adopting something potentially.","startTime":"27:25","endTime":"27:31","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right?","startTime":"27:31","endTime":"27:31","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Exactly.","startTime":"27:31","endTime":"27:32","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it's really horrible to adopt something and then later realize that everything, everyone is going to just abandon that anyway.","startTime":"27:32","endTime":"27:39","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So why did we do all that effort and support it forever after that?","startTime":"27:40","endTime":"27:44","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So no, we also want to make sure that we don't do too much of silly things that we have to just carry with us for all eternity.","startTime":"27:44","endTime":"27:53","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that brings me to another question, which is about backward compatibility.","startTime":"27:53","endTime":"27:56","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You guys have been very good at that historically, but I guess at some point in the future protocols will be dropped, I would imagine, because either they're not used or is there philosophical stance that nothing ever will be dropped.","startTime":"27:56","endTime":"28:11","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"How do you see that?","startTime":"28:11","endTime":"28:12","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"My philosophical stance is more like if no one notices, then when we drop stuff then it's okay.","startTime":"28:13","endTime":"28:20","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's not a behavior break.","startTime":"28:22","endTime":"28:24","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If no behavior is actually broken.","startTime":"28:24","endTime":"28:27","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So if no one is actually using it then we can actually remove it.","startTime":"28:27","endTime":"28:32","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But if you have no telemetry to tell you that.","startTime":"28:32","endTime":"28:35","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Exactly.","startTime":"28:35","endTime":"28:36","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that's a sort of.","startTime":"28:36","endTime":"28:37","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, that's a weird answer because I actually don't know.","startTime":"28:37","endTime":"28:40","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There's going, whatever we do, there's going to be two people somewhere in that exact, there are using whatever we have done ever.","startTime":"28:40","endTime":"28:48","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we are really careful about removing support for anything.","startTime":"28:48","endTime":"28:53","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we don't remove support for entire protocols.","startTime":"28:53","endTime":"28:56","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We can remove support for some stuff, but for example if we have things that you can enable in the tool or in the library ask for this to be used, then we didn't guarantee for it to be used.","startTime":"28:56","endTime":"29:09","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"29:09","endTime":"29:09","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we can not use it because you can still ask for it.","startTime":"29:09","endTime":"29:12","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It'll just never happen and things like that.","startTime":"29:12","endTime":"29:15","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it is possible.","startTime":"29:15","endTime":"29:16","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And we also have dropped support for a lot of different third party dependencies and offer new third party dependencies instead, which so from the outside is still the same, but internally we stopped supporting some TL's libraries and stuff like that because they were, they die off.","startTime":"29:16","endTime":"29:35","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"29:36","endTime":"29:37","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then do you have a protocol for, I guess deprecation, notifications and stuff like that in the CLI or how do you communicate these?","startTime":"29:37","endTime":"29:47","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"29:47","endTime":"29:48","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yes.","startTime":"29:48","endTime":"29:48","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we have a procedure in the project how we do when we remove things from the project.","startTime":"29:49","endTime":"29:54","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we have a pretty long time so that we warn and alert about when we want to do changes.","startTime":"29:54","endTime":"30:01","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So at the minimum, six months ahead, we sort of document exactly what we want to do.","startTime":"30:01","endTime":"30:06","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What the outcome is.","startTime":"30:06","endTime":"30:07","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And if you have a problem with this, you can always yell about it and we can sort of bring up the discussion and either postpone it or just cancel the precision completely or whatever, because everything is always up for discussion.","startTime":"30:07","endTime":"30:20","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we can always change our minds as long as anyone wants to do.","startTime":"30:20","endTime":"30:25","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it's also open source, so you could always fork it and just keep it the way it is if you so desire.","startTime":"30:25","endTime":"30:29","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right?","startTime":"30:29","endTime":"30:29","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"30:29","endTime":"30:30","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And there's always a matter of sure if you show up and you want to be a contributor and help keep the code in shape and everything.","startTime":"30:30","endTime":"30:36","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So of course that changes the equation.","startTime":"30:36","endTime":"30:38","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"30:38","endTime":"30:39","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So then of course we can support whatever, if there's someone there who is actually using it, have a use case and make sure that we have test cases and everything is good, then I, then we don't remove it.","startTime":"30:39","endTime":"30:49","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But do you still sign off?","startTime":"30:49","endTime":"30:51","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I usually don't do that.","startTime":"30:51","endTime":"30:52","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, exactly.","startTime":"30:52","endTime":"30:53","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Do you still sign off every PR coming in?","startTime":"30:53","endTime":"30:56","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"No, I don't.","startTime":"30:57","endTime":"30:58","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I review almost every PR, I think.","startTime":"30:58","endTime":"31:06","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But we are several committers and so there are a few bunch of other people who are actually merging quite a few changes.","startTime":"31:06","endTime":"31:14","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I think I'm at 56% of all commits authored.","startTime":"31:15","endTime":"31:19","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"31:20","endTime":"31:20","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But it's, my share is sort of shrinking over time because we have a lot of other good people who are doing a lot of development.","startTime":"31:20","endTime":"31:28","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But you are the only, I guess, paid maintainer of curl.","startTime":"31:29","endTime":"31:32","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"There are no other paid maintainers to work full time on it.","startTime":"31:32","endTime":"31:35","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"More.","startTime":"31:35","endTime":"31:35","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I'm the only full time paid maintainer, yes.","startTime":"31:35","endTime":"31:38","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I've actually off and on, I hire a few of the others, depending on what kind of assignments I have and what kind of money I have to spend on them.","startTime":"31:38","endTime":"31:49","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I actually pay a few of the others on and off.","startTime":"31:49","endTime":"31:53","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"31:53","endTime":"31:54","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"31:54","endTime":"31:55","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What was the biggest pain in the ass protocol to maintain, or what is, or was, I guessed.","startTime":"31:57","endTime":"32:06","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Curl is HTTP and HTTPs.","startTime":"32:10","endTime":"32:13","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They are the two big protocols that people use for curl.","startTime":"32:13","endTime":"32:17","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And with curl they're also super big and super complicated protocols.","startTime":"32:17","endTime":"32:23","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And since those two go hand in hand, right, because it's mostly most used and big complicated protocols, that means that we have most features with them and most of edge cases and most users doing things in crazy ways because there are such big protocols used in so many different ways, I think a fair amount of everything we do is around HTTP and HTTPs.","startTime":"32:23","endTime":"32:48","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So even though they are the most used and most tested and most well maintained, they're also the ones that are causing us the most problems because there are so much, they're just very complicated.","startTime":"32:49","endTime":"33:03","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They started out easy.","startTime":"33:03","endTime":"33:04","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Well, yeah, they were probably easy back in the early nineties, but they have developed into beasts really.","startTime":"33:04","endTime":"33:12","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And now with so many different protocol versions too, and different combinations of those and enter proxies and proxies of different versions and then all those different headers and things you can do with the content with different versions in different ways.","startTime":"33:13","endTime":"33:29","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"33:30","endTime":"33:30","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's a never ending sort of challenge to keep all of that together.","startTime":"33:30","endTime":"33:36","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I'm curious, obviously in the last five years, Cloudflare has eaten up so much of the traffic and acts as an intermediary for so much traffic.","startTime":"33:36","endTime":"33:48","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"They do interfere with headers, so they do add their own headers and they do modify how packets flow, I guess.","startTime":"33:48","endTime":"33:56","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Have you seen any, I guess, positive or negative change as a client with curl since that change has happened over the last few years?","startTime":"33:57","endTime":"34:07","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think in general, the entire trend with everything, everyone going behind cdns, I think in general that makes things easier for me as a client because it reduces to sort of the plethora of different implementations and different servers.","startTime":"34:08","endTime":"34:26","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we're going into a future with fewer server versions, so less diversity really among server implementations and crazy things that are happening in the server side that we have to adopt to as a client.","startTime":"34:26","endTime":"34:43","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I think in some ways it's easier, but in most ways it doesn't really matter to us.","startTime":"34:43","endTime":"34:49","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's the same thing because they appear as servers for us.","startTime":"34:49","endTime":"34:53","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"34:53","endTime":"34:53","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we have to work with any server, and if that happens to be a CDN, it's just a server as another server to us.","startTime":"34:53","endTime":"35:01","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, I was just thinking if they sanitize the data in some way, that makes it easier for curl to ask.","startTime":"35:01","endTime":"35:07","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I mean, I guess they would have to swallow up those edge cases on their end rather.","startTime":"35:07","endTime":"35:12","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, I guess so.","startTime":"35:12","endTime":"35:13","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But yeah, but I guess, you know, if they take 25% of the Internet, so sure they make that 25%, perhaps a little bit more cleaned up, but we still have all the other 75% served by others.","startTime":"35:13","endTime":"35:24","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And if there's a server out there that is sending a crazy header somewhere and that's used in production, you can be sure that we will see that at some point and then we have to deal with it, even though Cloudflare or the other CDNs will hide them for their particular clients.","startTime":"35:24","endTime":"35:40","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Fair enough, fair enough.","startTime":"35:40","endTime":"35:41","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What's the craziest use case you've seen of Curl so far, where you're like, wait, what?","startTime":"35:42","endTime":"35:48","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"One of my favorite ones that I actually learned about, I think, was about a year ago when some we shouldn't names but they made their niche printer manufacturer.","startTime":"35:50","endTime":"36:01","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They actually used Curl as an internal IPC in their printer.","startTime":"36:01","endTime":"36:05","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So they actually did curl communications between the different processes in the printer.","startTime":"36:05","endTime":"36:10","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's an interesting use case.","startTime":"36:12","endTime":"36:13","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I thought it was crazy.","startTime":"36:14","endTime":"36:15","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Completely non ideal.","startTime":"36:15","endTime":"36:18","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But they did it.","startTime":"36:18","endTime":"36:20","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It feels a bit like if you got a hammer, everything looks like a nail kind of situation.","startTime":"36:21","endTime":"36:25","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"36:25","endTime":"36:25","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And they contacted me because when you use libcurl, you basically set up so that it'll automatically keep x number of connections alive after you've used

alive.","startTime":"36:35","endTime":"36:39","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So the next request will be much faster.","startTime":"36:39","endTime":"36:41","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right, right.","startTime":"36:41","endTime":"36:42","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And they had like, they had that maximum number of connections to, I believe, five or six or whatever, and they had, I think, seven or eight nodes within that printer.","startTime":"36:42","endTime":"36:51","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Oh, right.","startTime":"36:51","endTime":"36:51","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So basically they communicated with tiny amount too many, so they would close down connections all the time.","startTime":"36:51","endTime":"36:57","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So they had to close them and create new ones all the time.","startTime":"36:57","endTime":"37:00","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So within that, even within that silly little printer, they have to sort of create and close down connections all the time.","startTime":"37:00","endTime":"37:06","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it's totally ineffective and really slow.","startTime":"37:06","endTime":"37:09","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it was a bad idea to begin with and then use it in a bad way.","startTime":"37:11","endTime":"37:14","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That made it even worse.","startTime":"37:14","endTime":"37:16","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Any other crazy use case that you can spring to mind of that you've seen?","startTime":"37:18","endTime":"37:21","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Actually, not that many, because I think a general trend is that everything is talking network these days.","startTime":"37:24","endTime":"37:30","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"37:30","endTime":"37:31","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So.","startTime":"37:31","endTime":"37:31","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And with everything is even talking even more networks tomorrow.","startTime":"37:31","endTime":"37:34","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So everything is potentially going to use curl sooner or later because everything is going to be networked in some way or another.","startTime":"37:34","endTime":"37:42","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, that's a fair point.","startTime":"37:42","endTime":"37:43","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So therefore there's not a single product that I can't imagine having curl eventually.","startTime":"37:43","endTime":"37:50","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, fair point.","startTime":"37:50","endTime":"37:52","speaker_name":"Viktor

spin out is not the right word, is w curl, which came out, I think it was a debian project, right?","startTime":"37:55","endTime":"38:01","speaker_name":"Viktor

wget.","startTime":"38:14","endTime":"38:18","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We get told that quite a lot, quite often.","startTime":"38:19","endTime":"38:21","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So, and I think this particular project, that wcurl is just a shell script, right?","startTime":"38:21","endTime":"38:27","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's a shell script wrapping curl.","startTime":"38:27","endTime":"38:29","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But Samuel, who created it, he, I think he read a lot of feedback from our recent curl user

you should use to just get that URL down to a file is complicated.","startTime":"38:43","endTime":"38:49","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that's why people in many cases still use wget.","startTime":"38:49","endTime":"38:52","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So by providing this wCarl script, the idea being then that, well, this could then be a reason to maybe not install wget if this is the only reason.","startTime":"38:52","endTime":"39:02","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right, right.","startTime":"39:02","endTime":"39:04","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I mean, one of the things, I mean this has come back to like the old school Linux world and I, and the Unix philosophy, I guess with the whole thing you do, one thing you do well and it's, and what I like about Curl is how well it works with the piping.","startTime":"39:04","endTime":"39:17","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"39:17","endTime":"39:17","speaker_name":"Viktor

yeah.","startTime":"39:23","endTime":"39:24","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I mean that's, it's such a good example of a tool that does one thing, very sharp focus

from one tool into the other tool.","startTime":"39:35","endTime":"39:39","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So of course curl would pipe everything into whatever you wanted to do.","startTime":"39:39","endTime":"39:43","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And for me it was always sort of, that's how we define curl.","startTime":"39:43","endTime":"39:47","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It shouldn't ever really understand the data.","startTime":"39:47","endTime":"39:50","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It just gets the data for you or uploads the data for you, but it doesn't understand the data.","startTime":"39:50","endTime":"39:54","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If you want something to understand the data, you pipe that data into that thing that

JSON.","startTime":"40:01","endTime":"40:04","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you pipe the thing into the thing that knows about JSON and it can show the JSON for you.","startTime":"40:04","endTime":"40:09","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"40:09","endTime":"40:09","speaker_name":"Viktor

parsing.","startTime":"40:09","endTime":"40:15","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We have a lot of people asking for that, but I can imagine I'm trying to stay up exactly for that reason.","startTime":"40:15","endTime":"40:23","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think there's always the potential for feature creep because there's always this, we're getting bombarded not only with ideas, but patches and things people want to put in there.","startTime":"40:23","endTime":"40:37","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"40:38","endTime":"40:38","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We could go in any direction at any point, but I think it's important to remember what Curl is not, or rather where's the boundary, what can we consider and what's definitely not considered?","startTime":"40:38","endTime":"40:49","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I think sort of dealing with the data, I think it's a pretty good and clear line.","startTime":"40:49","endTime":"40:54","speaker_name":"Daniel

no.","startTime":"40:55","endTime":"40:56","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's outside of the curl project.","startTime":"40:56","endTime":"40:57","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Understanding the data, that's not our business.","startTime":"40:57","endTime":"40:59","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I try to keep that as a sort of, yes, we're on this side of the fence, that's the other side.","startTime":"40:59","endTime":"41:05","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, I completely agree with I think that principle because if you add Jason, we know it.","startTime":"41:06","endTime":"41:12","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Somebody's going to ask for xml and before they add that.","startTime":"41:12","endTime":"41:14","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Exactly.","startTime":"41:14","endTime":"41:15","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that said, of course it's, sometimes it's hard to stick to that boundary.","startTime":"41:16","endTime":"41:20","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And of course in some way, sometimes the boundaries shifted a little bit because everything is always a discussion.","startTime":"41:20","endTime":"41:28","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I also, I'm also sort of always vary that I cannot always just get stuck in a mindset that we set like 26 years ago.","startTime":"41:28","endTime":"41:38","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"41:38","endTime":"41:39","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because things change.","startTime":"41:39","endTime":"41:40","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's not necessarily that we did the right decisions in the past.","startTime":"41:40","endTime":"41:44","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Maybe we should reevaluate and do things a little bit different because maybe things are, but.","startTime":"41:45","endTime":"41:49","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I always want to at least exercise that thought.","startTime":"41:49","endTime":"41:54","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But there are some boundaries I think we should really stick to.","startTime":"41:54","endTime":"41:58","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And for example, I always try to emphasize that curl is also for just uploads and downloads, transfer oriented.","startTime":"41:58","endTime":"42:05","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So if you come to me and say hey, I want to support protocol, blah, that is not about uploads or downloads, then nah, that's not for me.","startTime":"42:05","endTime":"42:14","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I also want the protocols to be oriented around URL's.","startTime":"42:14","endTime":"42:18","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it should be ideally a scheme for that particular protocol for curl to use it.","startTime":"42:18","endTime":"42:26","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I guess you have feature creeps a little bit there because if I'm not mistaken there's even support for shfs and similar things that are like.","startTime":"42:26","endTime":"42:36","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, I guess so.","startTime":"42:37","endTime":"42:38","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But it's, yeah, there's this, I mean feature creep.","startTime":"42:38","endTime":"42:42","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yes.","startTime":"42:42","endTime":"42:42","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So there's a lot of features.","startTime":"42:44","endTime":"42:45","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So yeah it's, and it's hard to turn down features because there's always a niche for adding things.","startTime":"42:45","endTime":"42:53","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, yeah, you support everything but you forgot to add this little tiny detail.","startTime":"42:53","endTime":"42:57","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, okay, well support for that and then another tiny detail that we don't support.","startTime":"42:57","endTime":"43:02","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We add support for that on and on and on.","startTime":"43:02","endTime":"43:05","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Then you end up with 263 command line options.","startTime":"43:05","endTime":"43:08","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, I completely understand that.","startTime":"43:09","endTime":"43:11","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"All right, let's switch topic a bit to security because if there is something that should be pretty painstakingly obvious right now in particular in light of the XZ vulnerability, is that Libcurl is probably one of the most prime suspects for injection if you want to backdoor any system on the planet.","startTime":"43:11","endTime":"43:33","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So let's talk that what are the mitigation strategies in place right now to make sure that doesn't happen for supply chains attack and whatnot?","startTime":"43:34","endTime":"43:43","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, well I think we do just about everything we can do.","startTime":"43:44","endTime":"43:50","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So first of all, the Xe attack was awesomely sort of performed by the attackers.","startTime":"43:50","endTime":"43:59","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But they also had the most excellent project to attack in several ways.","startTime":"43:59","endTime":"44:05","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right?","startTime":"44:05","endTime":"44:05","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yes.","startTime":"44:05","endTime":"44:05","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And one of the ways being that they had huge binary blobs in the test suite that was perfect for smuggle encrypted attacks.","startTime":"44:06","endTime":"44:14","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that's one of the things, right?","startTime":"44:14","endTime":"44:16","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We don't have anything that is no uninspectable blobs in the git repository.","startTime":"44:16","endTime":"44:24","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And of course, and then we do everything I think that we should.","startTime":"44:24","endTime":"44:28","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Everything is tested a lot and we review everything.","startTime":"44:28","endTime":"44:33","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Well, I review almost everything.","startTime":"44:34","endTime":"44:37","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I can actually confess that I do a lot of merges that only I review.","startTime":"44:37","endTime":"44:41","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I am suddenly sort of the weak link here.","startTime":"44:41","endTime":"44:45","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But anyway, so that's what we do.","startTime":"44:46","endTime":"44:48","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then we try to then make sure that we never merge anything that breaks any tests.","startTime":"44:48","endTime":"44:52","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so if the tests are fine and verify everything shouldn't be possible to put any backdoors in.","startTime":"44:52","endTime":"44:57","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Well ideally it shouldn't.","startTime":"44:57","endTime":"44:59","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then we do.","startTime":"44:59","endTime":"45:00","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Eventually we do, since a short while back we do entirely reproducible torball builds.","startTime":"45:00","endTime":"45:07","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it should be possible for anyone to just verify it and build.","startTime":"45:08","endTime":"45:12","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Exactly binary identical release.","startTime":"45:13","endTime":"45:15","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, that's all for a attack vector.","startTime":"45:16","endTime":"45:18","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"45:18","endTime":"45:18","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But let's talk about that, because that's obviously a big push we're seeing with deterministic builds.","startTime":"45:18","endTime":"45:22","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So walk me through that.","startTime":"45:23","endTime":"45:24","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"How was that process?","startTime":"45:24","endTime":"45:25","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"How do you find that?","startTime":"45:25","endTime":"45:26","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because obviously that's a big daunting task to do for many projects.","startTime":"45:26","endTime":"45:30","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, but it's not that hard for us.","startTime":"45:30","endTime":"45:33","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Release for us is just terrible.","startTime":"45:33","endTime":"45:35","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we're only releasing source code at least.","startTime":"45:35","endTime":"45:39","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Well it's not entirely true, but we're focusing on those releases now.","startTime":"45:39","endTime":"45:44","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"At least that's the primary release.","startTime":"45:44","endTime":"45:47","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's terrible.","startTime":"45:47","endTime":"45:48","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And when we do a terrible, we actually do the releases in a similar style as XZ because we use water tools.","startTime":"45:48","endTime":"45:56","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we generate a configure and stuff.","startTime":"45:56","endTime":"45:57","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And the generated configure is not in git.","startTime":"45:57","endTime":"46:00","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So of course in the XZ attack they then injected code between what's in git and what ended up in the turbo.","startTime":"46:01","endTime":"46:10","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that's why the reproducible build is important, because then you can verify that there's nothing ended up in the tarbol that wasn't in git or wasn't generated with a yemenite established tool.","startTime":"46:10","endTime":"46:21","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So basically we just then make sure that when we build that turbo, we do that in a reproducible way.","startTime":"46:22","endTime":"46:28","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So nowadays I build a tarball with a docker image of a specific hash, basically with the exact tools and make sure that the torbo is built with the right timestamps, blah, blah, so that if you just rerun the same command line that I did, you get an identical copy of the release turbo.","startTime":"46:30","endTime":"46:51","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it's actually pretty straightforward once we got all those tiny details just done correctly.","startTime":"46:52","endTime":"46:57","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay, that's fair enough.","startTime":"46:57","endTime":"46:59","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That's fair enough.","startTime":"46:59","endTime":"46:59","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So then the big sort of.","startTime":"47:00","endTime":"47:04","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I wouldn't say that it's a big, but the risk is really then that we would just merge someone's back door, you know, someone trying to just deliberately deliver a patch that says, hey, this patch is doing x and it looks good and we merge it, but in reality it actually does y.","startTime":"47:04","endTime":"47:22","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then down the line someone can exploit that and use that backdoor.","startTime":"47:22","endTime":"47:26","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I have never even seen an attempt do that.","startTime":"47:27","endTime":"47:30","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Maybe I've just missed it and we have it already.","startTime":"47:30","endTime":"47:32","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I claim that it's really difficult to deliberately plant a backdoor like that does anything substantial.","startTime":"47:32","endTime":"47:41","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think the actual biggest risk for curl, as in many other projects, is just the accidental vulnerability thing that we actually did something stupid a while ago that you can exploit.","startTime":"47:44","endTime":"47:56","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then by exploiting a buffer, some kind of crash, some kind of thing, and that's what you can exploit and do something nasty.","startTime":"47:56","endTime":"48:05","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that kind of security vulnerabilities we of course find and fix every now and then.","startTime":"48:05","endTime":"48:11","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean that's more in the domain of regular vulnerabilities.","startTime":"48:11","endTime":"48:14","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"More so than supply chain attacks, I guess.","startTime":"48:14","endTime":"48:16","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"48:16","endTime":"48:17","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And looking back at the history of those, you can see that most of those mistakes were mine, so I know they weren't planted.","startTime":"48:17","endTime":"48:22","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, that's fair.","startTime":"48:24","endTime":"48:25","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So one thing that, I mean, obviously you all guys are doing really well.","startTime":"48:26","endTime":"48:30","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I mean, I looked at the openSSF scorecard for Curl and you have a golden status for openSF scorecard, which is a pretty impressive score actually, because not a

right.","startTime":"48:43","endTime":"48:44","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I really made an effort to make sure that we sort of qualify for all those criteria and so.","startTime":"48:44","endTime":"48:49","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yes, but you're not actually, I don't think you ever mention that anywhere else that there is an opensSF scorecard that you actually aced, which I think is a lost marketing opportunity because I think that should be for, that should be the front for Readme of the off the readme file on GitHub, honestly.","startTime":"48:49","endTime":"49:04","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"49:04","endTime":"49:04","speaker_name":"Daniel

I should stress that harder.","startTime":"49:06","endTime":"49:09","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, I think.","startTime":"49:09","endTime":"49:10","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, no, that's impressive.","startTime":"49:10","endTime":"49:13","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Very few projects actually qualify that gets that far.","startTime":"49:13","endTime":"49:16","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's actually pretty good that the best practice.","startTime":"49:17","endTime":"49:20","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So openssF has that best practice site that actually has a lot of questions to fill in.","startTime":"49:21","endTime":"49:27","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If you sort of follow a lot of different best practices.","startTime":"49:27","endTime":"49:32","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think it's actually really good.","startTime":"49:32","endTime":"49:33","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Sort of just a checklist if you can say yes to all of those, you know, that you're doing things at least not bad.","startTime":"49:33","endTime":"49:40","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that's what I've tried to sort of why I went for the gold too, because I want to make sure that we do everything as good as we possibly can in pretty much every aspect when it comes to running an open source project.","startTime":"49:40","endTime":"49:53","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And also I would say it's a critical piece of infrastructure as well that so many people depend on that.","startTime":"49:53","endTime":"49:59","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I mean I'm glad you see you guys are focusing on that because that is so important, right?","startTime":"49:59","endTime":"50:05","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"50:05","endTime":"50:05","speaker_name":"Daniel

one, you know, it's a success that no one is yelling about it.","startTime":"50:07","endTime":"50:13","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"50:13","endTime":"50:13","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So if as long as no one actually finds their heart

good as long as no one finds anything alarming.","startTime":"50:20","endTime":"50:23","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we should just keep it that way.","startTime":"50:23","endTime":"50:25","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And of course it's an ongoing effort because it never ends.","startTime":"50:25","endTime":"50:29","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Oh yeah.","startTime":"50:29","endTime":"50:30","speaker_name":"Viktor

curl?","startTime":"50:40","endTime":"50:43","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think we're just following what everyone else is doing.","startTime":"50:45","endTime":"50:47","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that's also why I talked about our releases are only turbo so we don't actually have any third parties in the tarbella.","startTime":"50:47","endTime":"50:58","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We actually don't have any bill of material in that way.","startTime":"50:58","endTime":"51:02","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I guess that's because we just ship the code.","startTime":"51:02","endTime":"51:04","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So someone else is building stuff.","startTime":"51:04","endTime":"51:07","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we just push the responsibility to the others who are actually building everything and they're responsible.","startTime":"51:07","endTime":"51:13","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So basically all the distros that are shipping curl and everything, they build it themselves.","startTime":"51:13","endTime":"51:18","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So they get it from us, they build it and they include third party dependencies and everything.","startTime":"51:18","endTime":"51:22","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So they are the ones who are actually get to do that.","startTime":"51:22","endTime":"51:27","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I guess you have dependency tree inside of curl.","startTime":"51:27","endTime":"51:30","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I would imagine you are depending on some other third party piece of.","startTime":"51:30","endTime":"51:34","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Not strictly, we only depend on them when you build curl to use them.","startTime":"51:34","endTime":"51:39","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that's why we don't have the dependency when we ship curl.","startTime":"51:40","endTime":"51:43","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because then you have to build it.","startTime":"51:43","endTime":"51:45","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's fair enough.","startTime":"51:45","endTime":"51:46","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But it's useless in isolation, I guess, without building it.","startTime":"51:46","endTime":"51:52","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right, exactly.","startTime":"51:52","endTime":"51:53","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"51:53","endTime":"51:53","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But that's also one way that we sort of duck for a lot of issues.","startTime":"51:53","endTime":"51:58","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so we, since we don't ship the binaries, handling the binary thing there is not, so that we avoid a lot of issues and problems by doing it this way.","startTime":"51:58","endTime":"52:10","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We do ship a few binaries anyway.","startTime":"52:10","endTime":"52:13","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That sort of breaks what I'm saying.","startTime":"52:13","endTime":"52:15","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we do offer binaries for windows, for example.","startTime":"52:15","endTime":"52:20","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"52:20","endTime":"52:21","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So and then in that case we have a pretty, we don't have any really s bombs because pretty much, I think, I don't know really why, but we have a huge detailed log about everything and exactly that we ship and include in that.","startTime":"52:21","endTime":"52:36","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So all of that is transparent and available.","startTime":"52:36","endTime":"52:39","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think we're pretty much, we're well covered in that aspect too.","startTime":"52:40","endTime":"52:45","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I think if we ever land on, we should do this to provide s pumps in this format more universally then I'm sure that we will do that as well.","startTime":"52:45","endTime":"52:54","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's fair enough.","startTime":"52:54","endTime":"52:54","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That's fair enough.","startTime":"52:54","endTime":"52:55","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Let's talk CV's because you posted a blog post last year.","startTime":"52:56","endTime":"53:00","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think it was about the useless or everything that is wrong with CV's, which I think was a kind of entertaining read about a CV filed against Curl, which is kind of I guess a theoretical attack in some sense.","startTime":"53:00","endTime":"53:15","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But let's talk a bit about that.","startTime":"53:15","endTime":"53:16","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Do you want to recap the article a bit about this CV and your thoughts on that?","startTime":"53:17","endTime":"53:21","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yes, so I actually, so I had this struggle against the CV in many, I've had a lot of weird CV's and security related things over the last few years, but I believe in that case it was a integer overflow in a delay argument to curl.","startTime":"53:21","endTime":"53:42","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So if you ask curl to retry on a failed transfer because it has that command line option, basically if the server returns internal error or overloaded or whatever, you can ask her to try again later.","startTime":"53:42","endTime":"54:01","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Sure.","startTime":"54:02","endTime":"54:02","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then it'll try 3 seconds later or 12 seconds later.","startTime":"54:02","endTime":"54:06","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Then we have another option that says wait this amount of time until you'd retry again.","startTime":"54:06","endTime":"54:11","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"One of those days we just fixed the little buffer overflow.","startTime":"54:14","endTime":"54:17","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So when you set that retry counter to you specify it in seconds and internally we multiply that by 1000 to get the timer into milliseconds and we didn't have any check for that.","startTime":"54:17","endTime":"54:30","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So if you set that retry delay to something enormously big, and we will multiply that by 1000.","startTime":"54:30","endTime":"54:38","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Sure.","startTime":"54:38","endTime":"54:39","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It'll sort of.","startTime":"54:39","endTime":"54:41","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, it will overflow the integer or the long or whatever I don't remember the variable type, but it was a 64 bit on Linux.","startTime":"54:41","endTime":"54:48","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So yes, then you get an integral overflow.","startTime":"54:48","endTime":"54:51","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So if you then ask curl to retry like once in every 68 million years, and then instead it would retry once every probably 0 second or 60 milliseconds or whatever it turned out it would wrap and become a very small number instead of insanely large.","startTime":"54:51","endTime":"55:10","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I consider that just a bug because first of all, no one would ever enter that huge number unless you actually wanted to trigger this.","startTime":"55:11","endTime":"55:21","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay, and that's fair, someone could do that.","startTime":"55:21","endTime":"55:23","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But what's the worst that could happen?","startTime":"55:23","endTime":"55:27","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It wouldn't wait 68 million years.","startTime":"55:27","endTime":"55:28","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It would actually do the retry immediately after it failed the first one.","startTime":"55:28","endTime":"55:33","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that is exactly how curl behaves.","startTime":"55:33","endTime":"55:35","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If you just type multiple URL's after each other on the command line, it would be one, two, three, exactly as it always does.","startTime":"55:35","endTime":"55:41","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So yeah, okay, worst case, it doesn't wait forever, it'll just do the next request immediately.","startTime":"55:41","endTime":"55:46","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And someone then found out that I used the word integral in a commit message because it was.","startTime":"55:47","endTime":"55:55","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And someone then registered.","startTime":"55:55","endTime":"55:57","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And CV is just a bug id basically.","startTime":"55:57","endTime":"56:01","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you can just ask for that from mitre or whoever is responsible for that.","startTime":"56:01","endTime":"56:06","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And someone then requested a CVE for this bug.","startTime":"56:06","endTime":"56:08","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And one day that suddenly just became public because obviously no one told us about it.","startTime":"56:09","endTime":"56:16","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So just one day this CVE becomes public.","startTime":"56:16","endTime":"56:19","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Integral overflowing curl and rated severity 9.8, I think.","startTime":"56:19","endTime":"56:26","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because that's an integral overflow.","startTime":"56:27","endTime":"56:29","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What's the worst that can happen with an integral overflow?","startTime":"56:29","endTime":"56:32","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Probably really serious stuff can happen, right?","startTime":"56:32","endTime":"56:34","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If it had been in some place that actually matters.","startTime":"56:34","endTime":"56:39","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I of course was just what a CV on.","startTime":"56:40","endTime":"56:43","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because usually we manage all the CV's ourselves, of course, because people report to us, so we know about it, we do the fixes, we talk about it, we announce the details, we write about it, so on.","startTime":"56:43","endTime":"56:54","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But in this case, of course it just showed up out of the blue one day.","startTime":"56:54","endTime":"56:58","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then of course it became this huge discussion, is this a security problem?","startTime":"57:00","endTime":"57:04","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I'm a pragmatic guy, I hate this guy.","startTime":"57:04","endTime":"57:09","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Sure, it's an integral overflow.","startTime":"57:09","endTime":"57:11","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Integral overflows written in c.","startTime":"57:11","endTime":"57:12","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They're undefined according to the C standard.","startTime":"57:12","endTime":"57:16","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then the most nihilistic people, they say undefined, then anything can happen.","startTime":"57:16","endTime":"57:22","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So yeah, that's true.","startTime":"57:23","endTime":"57:26","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"By the sort of literal meaning of the words it's undefined, it means that anything can happen.","startTime":"57:26","endTime":"57:31","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's actually true.","startTime":"57:31","endTime":"57:32","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So in theory, instead of wrapping everything to 32 milliseconds, instead of 68 million years it could actually do something seriously super crazy and you know, your computer might burn.","startTime":"57:32","endTime":"57:44","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I think that's a really silly argument to have because you can try it through how many compilers you want added and see what do compilers actually do with it.","startTime":"57:46","endTime":"57:56","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And well they can wrap that integral in many different ways and some could actually in some ways do something somewhat strange, but in no way did that ever become a security problem.","startTime":"57:57","endTime":"58:09","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Anyway, so that was my argument.","startTime":"58:10","endTime":"58:12","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So first I wanted to mitre to just reject the CVE because it was stupid.","startTime":"58:12","endTime":"58:16","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It wasn't a security problem at all.","startTime":"58:16","endTime":"58:18","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And they refuse to do that because yes, it's a security problem, they say, based on what, I don't know, because they won't talk to me.","startTime":"58:18","endTime":"58:25","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They just reply and say it's a security problem.","startTime":"58:25","endTime":"58:27","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then of course the score you see when you just google for the CVE is usually you end up on the NVD site, the national vulnerability database, and they set scores on CVE's.","startTime":"58:30","endTime":"58:46","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's just their business.","startTime":"58:46","endTime":"58:49","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So the next thing I did was that I contacted NVD and said hey, how on earth did you end up with a 9.8 for this when it's not even a security problem to begin with?","startTime":"58:49","endTime":"59:01","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And NVD, they don't remove anything because they say if Mitre added we will host it.","startTime":"59:01","endTime":"59:07","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So they won't reject it, they will just.","startTime":"59:07","endTime":"59:10","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They can, if I yell at them enough they can reevaluate the score apparently because they did in this case.","startTime":"59:10","endTime":"59:17","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So they reevaluated.","startTime":"59:17","endTime":"59:19","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So from 9.8 they ended up with 3.3, I think.","startTime":"59:19","endTime":"59:22","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay, just yelling.","startTime":"59:22","endTime":"59:26","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Significant drop.","startTime":"59:26","endTime":"59:28","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Exactly.","startTime":"59:28","endTime":"59:29","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And by that I figure, okay, sure, 3.3, you can have it like that because 3.3, I don't, I mean, sure.","startTime":"59:29","endTime":"59:36","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Then I think for me that sort of just sort of removed the issue from my table really.","startTime":"59:37","endTime":"59:43","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So okay, you can have it, 3.3, fine, if you want to.","startTime":"59:43","endTime":"59:46","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"In my view it's still a bad and invalid CVE, and I call it that.","startTime":"59:46","endTime":"59:50","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"On the curl webpage they say it's a 3.3.","startTime":"59:50","endTime":"59:53","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Sure, fair enough.","startTime":"59:53","endTime":"59:56","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"All right.","startTime":"59:56","endTime":"59:57","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The last thing I want to talk about, which I think you're in a very good position to speak about, is the future funding of open source because that's obviously a lot of the supply chain attacks in open source.","startTime":"59:57","endTime":"01:00:09","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"A lot of them stem from the fact that these are projects maintained by one or maybe a handful of people at most, but used everywhere.","startTime":"01:00:09","endTime":"01:00:18","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Curl is a great example of that where it has its fingers into almost everything that runs Linux or any embedded system more or less now.","startTime":"01:00:18","endTime":"01:00:30","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The funding is a hard part, right?","startTime":"01:00:30","endTime":"01:00:32","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You managed to do it by consulting, but it took you 20 some years to get there, right, which is 20 some years more than most projects.","startTime":"01:00:32","endTime":"01:00:40","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So how do you see the future of open source funding looking like with your experience in this domain?","startTime":"01:00:41","endTime":"01:00:49","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I don't have any answers.","startTime":"01:00:51","endTime":"01:00:52","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I don't have any magic bullets there either.","startTime":"01:00:52","endTime":"01:00:54","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So no, it's a challenge, of course, because I think just the market economy just makes it easy for anyone who wants to just get open source, use it for as long as you want for free.","startTime":"01:00:54","endTime":"01:01:10","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Never contribute anything back because you don't have to and you can run a successful business without contributing anything back at all.","startTime":"01:01:10","endTime":"01:01:18","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think that's the ultimate challenge because you can, companies can get away with it, so they will do that.","startTime":"01:01:20","endTime":"01:01:26","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it's really hard to, as a, as producers to suddenly say, hey, wait a minute, you should pay me.","startTime":"01:01:26","endTime":"01:01:31","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I've given everything away, but now I want you to pay because they don't have to and it's hard for them to do.","startTime":"01:01:31","endTime":"01:01:36","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Of course, I think in reality and for companies products to be sustainable in the long run, it benefits companies to help the projects that they depend on, right?","startTime":"01:01:37","endTime":"01:01:50","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that they can continue doing their products in the future so that all their dependencies also strive to, you know, continue and are secure and good and everything.","startTime":"01:01:50","endTime":"01:01:58","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it is good in a lot of companies own view as well.","startTime":"01:01:58","endTime":"01:02:04","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I think it's often overlooked by them and by the fact that they can avoid it.","startTime":"01:02:04","endTime":"01:02:10","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They often do that just out of short sightedness.","startTime":"01:02:10","endTime":"01:02:14","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And of course then there's the challenge in the other end.","startTime":"01:02:14","endTime":"01:02:18","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it's hard for some, in a lot of projects it's hard for people to even, just how do you even start getting money for anything?","startTime":"01:02:18","endTime":"01:02:28","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If it's a small project, surely it's not a full time thing, but who's going to pay for it?","startTime":"01:02:28","endTime":"01:02:33","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And how, and how do you go.","startTime":"01:02:34","endTime":"01:02:35","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"From a side project to a full time project?","startTime":"01:02:35","endTime":"01:02:38","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right, exactly.","startTime":"01:02:38","endTime":"01:02:39","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That was my challenge for so long time.","startTime":"01:02:39","endTime":"01:02:42","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"How do you do that, take that step?","startTime":"01:02:42","endTime":"01:02:43","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's really difficult.","startTime":"01:02:43","endTime":"01:02:44","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So yes, there are numerous challenges on how to do that.","startTime":"01:02:45","endTime":"01:02:48","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And at the same time, of course, if it's just your spare time thing, of course no one can actually require you to have everything top notch all the time.","startTime":"01:02:48","endTime":"01:02:55","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it's only natural that you slip and you have bugs or security problems or whatever in your, I mean it's your right to have that.","startTime":"01:02:55","endTime":"01:03:01","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's your spare time project you do what you want.","startTime":"01:03:01","endTime":"01:03:05","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's not for anyone else to require you to do anything on your spare time.","startTime":"01:03:05","endTime":"01:03:08","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Do you have any opinions around?","startTime":"01:03:09","endTime":"01:03:10","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So GitHub sponsors, for instance, they've been trying to gain some momentum.","startTime":"01:03:10","endTime":"01:03:14","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I mean, we've used that screenly for a while for our open source project.","startTime":"01:03:14","endTime":"01:03:17","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Some of that works.","startTime":"01:03:17","endTime":"01:03:18","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We have some.","startTime":"01:03:18","endTime":"01:03:19","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Has that worked with curl?","startTime":"01:03:20","endTime":"01:03:21","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Have you seen some success around that?","startTime":"01:03:21","endTime":"01:03:23","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Usually all the ways when you open up for sponsorship, it's good with sponsors.","startTime":"01:03:26","endTime":"01:03:32","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that allows people that it contributes in a easy way when possible.","startTime":"01:03:32","endTime":"01:03:37","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Usually sponsors never cover enough money to actually drive serious development, though, because usually sponsorships are mostly individuals.","startTime":"01:03:38","endTime":"01:03:47","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So sponsorships tend up to be in the smaller ranges.","startTime":"01:03:47","endTime":"01:03:50","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you need a huge amount of people actually shipping money for that to actually end up employing someone full time in a western world.","startTime":"01:03:50","endTime":"01:04:00","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it's really hard.","startTime":"01:04:00","endTime":"01:04:02","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You need companies involved to actually up the amounts and then you have to do something else than just ordinary sponsorships.","startTime":"01:04:02","endTime":"01:04:10","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's at least the usual way things go.","startTime":"01:04:10","endTime":"01:04:13","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, because I guess that's the problem, right.","startTime":"01:04:14","endTime":"01:04:16","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"If you are a good enough software engineer that you can write a great piece of software that people actually are using, your going rate on the market to join a company will be six figures in most western countries.","startTime":"01:04:16","endTime":"01:04:30","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Six figures a lot for an open source project.","startTime":"01:04:31","endTime":"01:04:33","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So that's basically your alternative option, right?","startTime":"01:04:34","endTime":"01:04:37","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yes, exactly.","startTime":"01:04:37","endTime":"01:04:38","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"01:04:39","endTime":"01:04:39","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it's certainly a challenge.","startTime":"01:04:39","endTime":"01:04:42","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I mean, I'm hoping that we have some progress that one of the things that we've at screen that we use open source a lot and one of the things we've been toying with internally is to have kind of a pool internally that we allocate each year to open source projects with a bias towards smaller projects.","startTime":"01:04:42","endTime":"01:05:03","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because I think the big projects like, I mean, I guess Curl is a big project by now in relative terms, and Django is and all postgres and all the other big top projects that we use.","startTime":"01:05:03","endTime":"01:05:13","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But for every one of those, there are plenty of smaller projects that maybe just be one guy.","startTime":"01:05:13","endTime":"01:05:18","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And my philosophy is the buyer should be on those guys because those are the guys who need the most, right?","startTime":"01:05:18","endTime":"01:05:25","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Most probably, yes.","startTime":"01:05:25","endTime":"01:05:26","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"01:05:28","endTime":"01:05:28","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So, yeah, exactly.","startTime":"01:05:28","endTime":"01:05:29","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's, that's one good way to do it.","startTime":"01:05:29","endTime":"01:05:31","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I think also it could possibly also be with angle to, I don't know, over maybe not overlooked projects.","startTime":"01:05:32","endTime":"01:05:40","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But there's also, I find a, I find it a challenge to be a component in a software tree.","startTime":"01:05:40","endTime":"01:05:48","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"01:05:48","endTime":"01:05:49","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I think it's a different case.","startTime":"01:05:49","endTime":"01:05:52","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"At least I sense that when I talk to other open source maintainers who do accept sponsorships.","startTime":"01:05:52","endTime":"01:05:58","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's a different case when you, for example, if you do more like more directed end user products, perhaps with more usability, so that you reach more, and then you get sponsorships directly from end users.","startTime":"01:05:58","endTime":"01:06:11","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But when you're doing a component in someone else's project, then the project using your stuff is the one who's going to get that visibility among users, not you.","startTime":"01:06:11","endTime":"01:06:21","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So there's a visibility challenge in that case.","startTime":"01:06:21","endTime":"01:06:26","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I mean.","startTime":"01:06:26","endTime":"01:06:27","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, and I think that has been very evident in the NPM world, right.","startTime":"01:06:27","endTime":"01:06:30","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Where you have had a lot of supply chains attack with domain squatting and squatting attacks and whatnot.","startTime":"01:06:30","endTime":"01:06:35","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"01:06:35","endTime":"01:06:35","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And you just.","startTime":"01:06:35","endTime":"01:06:38","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because a little component.","startTime":"01:06:38","endTime":"01:06:39","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"01:06:39","endTime":"01:06:39","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Used by everyone, but no one actually remembers that little component or even knew about it.","startTime":"01:06:39","endTime":"01:06:43","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right, exactly.","startTime":"01:06:43","endTime":"01:06:44","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And that's why I'm very bullish at S bombs, particularly when you're exploding s bombs that will bring light to that world.","startTime":"01:06:44","endTime":"01:06:51","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"01:06:51","endTime":"01:06:52","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"More so, hopefully.","startTime":"01:06:52","endTime":"01:06:55","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, it really should.","startTime":"01:06:55","endTime":"01:06:56","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"At least I think that it will.","startTime":"01:06:57","endTime":"01:06:59","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean, I think it'll take time, but I think at least that's sort of a necessary step towards visibility and knowledge and just making everyone aware exactly what the sort of the myriad of tiny projects that we're all building everything on top of.","startTime":"01:06:59","endTime":"01:07:14","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, it's like that XKCD cartoon, right, where you have all these projects and they have like the small, like.","startTime":"01:07:15","endTime":"01:07:21","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Oh, well, I think in that particular example, it's libsl or whatever it is.","startTime":"01:07:21","endTime":"01:07:25","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Lib opens cell or whatever it is.","startTime":"01:07:25","endTime":"01:07:27","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That it actually doesn't say the project.","startTime":"01:07:27","endTime":"01:07:30","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"All right, fair enough.","startTime":"01:07:30","endTime":"01:07:31","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, 23, 47.","startTime":"01:07:31","endTime":"01:07:33","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Fair enough.","startTime":"01:07:35","endTime":"01:07:36","speaker_name":"Daniel Stenberg","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But it depends.","startTime":"01:07:37","endTime":"01:07:38","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But it's illustrated as well, right?","startTime":"01:07:38","endTime":"01:07:40","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It is.","startTime":"01:07:40","endTime":"01:07:41","speaker_name":"Viktor
