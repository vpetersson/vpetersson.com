there a little bit and kind of use a stepping stone off.","startTime":"01:49","endTime":"01:52","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I guess so.","startTime":"01:52","endTime":"01:53","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I mean, even before that I, like in my earlier career, I set up a bunch of companies.","startTime":"01:53","endTime":"01:58","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"One of them was a web portal and sort of Internet service provider in East

there.","startTime":"02:13","endTime":"02:14","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so we did a lot of interesting things that grew users in a very organic way.","startTime":"02:15","endTime":"02:19","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Fast forward a bit.","startTime":"02:20","endTime":"02:20","speaker_name":"Chris

very much about it when I started because I was coming from tech and kind of building open source products.","startTime":"02:31","endTime":"02:36","speaker_name":"Chris

UNICEF does is has access in every country to the kind of parts of government that work with kids, ministries of education, ministries of health and so on.","startTime":"02:39","endTime":"02:48","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so in 2017, 1617, we had started at UNICEF, the first crypto fund in the public sector.","startTime":"02:48","endTime":"02:56","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it was entirely crypto denominated BTC and eth.","startTime":"02:57","endTime":"03:00","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And right before that, about three years before that, we started the first venture capital like fund.","startTime":"03:01","endTime":"03:05","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It was a grant capital fund.","startTime":"03:05","endTime":"03:07","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it did just do grants, it didn't do investments, but it mimicked a lot of the VC due diligence, the kind of term sheets and the way that we worked with our companies.","startTime":"03:07","endTime":"03:14","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so those two things, the crypto fund and the venture like fund, had really led us to see that there was an opportunity to find these exciting companies in emerging markets that were doing technology that could help people, whether these were drones in Malawi that were doing surveys of fields, or whether they were AI based chatbots in Brazil that we could then port into other languages and other places.","startTime":"03:14","endTime":"03:37","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But all of these companies stopped growing where the Internet stopped, which makes total sense because they're digital companies.","startTime":"03:37","endTime":"03:43","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So like no digital company.","startTime":"03:43","endTime":"03:45","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so we, you know, I started going back to the thing that I'd started with which is like, how do we get more Internet to more places?","startTime":"03:45","endTime":"03:51","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that's really where Giga began, was with the desire to help our portfolio companies grow.","startTime":"03:51","endTime":"03:57","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And at the same time the crypto stuff was really interesting to me because were able to move money, like do our capital calls from investors and get that money to investments in like seven minutes.","startTime":"03:57","endTime":"04:07","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you could go from an LP for our fund out to a company in Mexico in seven and a half minutes.","startTime":"04:07","endTime":"04:13","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But again, if that company wasn't well connected, if they didn't have good bandwidth, that digital transaction, which I think is so powerful, wasn't going anywhere.","startTime":"04:13","endTime":"04:21","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, so that was like, that was, you know, that was the problem at the beginning of the journey basically.","startTime":"04:21","endTime":"04:25","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"04:26","endTime":"04:26","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I remember I visited you in New York back then, see the Innovation fund and it really felt like an incubator in the sense that you would like instablank VC incubator, but like with the framing of doing good, I guess, in open source.","startTime":"04:26","endTime":"04:41","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So that was super interesting.","startTime":"04:41","endTime":"04:43","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Cool.","startTime":"04:43","endTime":"04:43","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you started giga.","startTime":"04:43","endTime":"04:45","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We covered Giga and done some digging here.","startTime":"04:45","endTime":"04:48","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then essentially it comes around large, what you're mentioning around schools.","startTime":"04:48","endTime":"04:53","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"04:53","endTime":"04:53","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So to talk me through kind of the mapping process, because it's as correct as pointed out, like, never been something I even thought about, like the dark number really, in how many schools are unconnected.","startTime":"04:53","endTime":"05:06","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And how did you go about even finding these schools that were not connected in any way?","startTime":"05:06","endTime":"05:11","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And it's such a random data point to even think about.","startTime":"05:12","endTime":"05:15","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So there were like three really important people who influenced the beginning of giga.","startTime":"05:15","endTime":"05:20","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so we had this intuition, right, that if we could extend Internet to places in emerging markets that it wasn't, we would be able to help companies grow faster.","startTime":"05:20","endTime":"05:28","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that's kind of like bubbling around in our heads.","startTime":"05:28","endTime":"05:29","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There were three people who said things to me that were much smarter than anything I was thinking.","startTime":"05:29","endTime":"05:33","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"One of them was my mentor at the time he passed away this last

Sapra.","startTime":"05:40","endTime":"05:41","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Sharad was a brilliant man.","startTime":"05:41","endTime":"05:43","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"He's the reason that I joined unicef.","startTime":"05:43","endTime":"05:45","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And at some point during this venture fund, in the crypto fund work, he said, chris, you know, why don't you use your tech skills and start doing something useful rather than all of this vc, blah, why don't you actually figure out like the answer to a real problem?","startTime":"05:45","endTime":"05:57","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I was like, okay, Sharad, you know, as my mentor who says things like that to me and inspires me, what's the real problem?","startTime":"05:57","endTime":"06:03","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And he's like, you know, you idiots don't even know how many schools there are in the world.","startTime":"06:04","endTime":"06:08","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I was like, well, what does that have to do with anything?","startTime":"06:08","endTime":"06:09","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And he's like, well, maybe it doesn't, but isn't that weird that you don't know that?","startTime":"06:09","endTime":"06:13","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Very simple.","startTime":"06:13","endTime":"06:13","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, wouldn't you think you should know that?","startTime":"06:13","endTime":"06:16","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so he sort of said that.","startTime":"06:16","endTime":"06:17","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I was, that was bubbling in my head.","startTime":"06:17","endTime":"06:19","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And he said, you know, you think you're so smart and you're counting rivets on bridges with some of the drone technology that you've been investing in, and you can figure out whether a bridge needs to be repaired, but you can't find the schools.","startTime":"06:20","endTime":"06:30","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so I started looking into that a little bit and I was like, that's.","startTime":"06:30","endTime":"06:32","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's a fair point.","startTime":"06:33","endTime":"06:34","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You know, government says they have a bunch of schools in their country, but do they really?","startTime":"06:34","endTime":"06:38","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Do we?","startTime":"06:38","endTime":"06:38","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Is it really true?","startTime":"06:38","endTime":"06:39","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And has anybody aggregated that?","startTime":"06:39","endTime":"06:40","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The answer is no.","startTime":"06:40","endTime":"06:41","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I was kind of there.","startTime":"06:41","endTime":"06:42","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then another friend named Greg Weiler.","startTime":"06:42","endTime":"06:44","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So Greg is a satellite guy.","startTime":"06:45","endTime":"06:46","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"He founded OneWeb and O3B and has a passion for all things space and satellites and connectivity.","startTime":"06:46","endTime":"06:54","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And Greg said, as were going through this, I was like, I'm gonna figure out where all the schools are, because that can't be very hard.","startTime":"06:54","endTime":"06:59","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Really?","startTime":"06:59","endTime":"07:00","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What does that guy Sharad know?","startTime":"07:00","endTime":"07:02","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So then said to talk to Greg, and Greg's like, wow, wouldn't it be great if you had these if you knew where the schools are?","startTime":"07:02","endTime":"07:08","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Which you should know, right, Chris?","startTime":"07:08","endTime":"07:10","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, obviously, everybody knows where the schools are.","startTime":"07:10","endTime":"07:12","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Wouldn't it be cool to have, like, a dashboard where you could see how connected the schools were in each country?","startTime":"07:12","endTime":"07:17","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I was like, interesting.","startTime":"07:18","endTime":"07:19","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I guess you'd need to know where the schools are to do that, but that would be good.","startTime":"07:20","endTime":"07:22","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And he said, you could have, like, a little green dot if it's connected and red dot if it's not.","startTime":"07:22","endTime":"07:25","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then the third person was a woman named Doreen Bogdan Martin, who's now the head of itu, the telecommunications agency for the union.","startTime":"07:25","endTime":"07:32","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"ITU is the International Telecommunications Union, and it's the, like, the oldest UN agency.","startTime":"07:32","endTime":"07:37","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They were built to regulate the telegraph originally.","startTime":"07:37","endTime":"07:39","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They're now doing, like, 6G policy, so go figure.","startTime":"07:41","endTime":"07:44","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And Doreen said to me that, you know, wouldn't it be interesting if we could combine the work that UNICEF has on schools and kids with ITU's regulatory power?","startTime":"07:44","endTime":"07:52","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And she wasn't the head of it at that point, but, you know, couldn't we bring something together?","startTime":"07:53","endTime":"07:56","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that was the sort of.","startTime":"07:56","endTime":"07:57","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Those were the three points of real inspiration.","startTime":"07:57","endTime":"08:00","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"A basic question that sounds so easy to ask, like, where all this goes in the world?","startTime":"08:00","endTime":"08:04","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's super hard to answer, right?","startTime":"08:04","endTime":"08:06","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"A kind of an ability to tie that to technology that I care about, which is QoS, like monitoring and kind of backhaul and traffic shaping, monitoring, and then the ability to connect to a regulatory agency that could do things that are interesting that are way outside of my scope and knowledge?","startTime":"08:06","endTime":"08:21","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that's how it started.","startTime":"08:22","endTime":"08:23","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That was like 2017, 18 and then.","startTime":"08:23","endTime":"08:25","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And people were kind of like, why do you need to connect schools anyway?","startTime":"08:25","endTime":"08:28","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then Covid happened, and that question was no longer ever asked, but still were stuck with this question of, like, where are all the schools?","startTime":"08:28","endTime":"08:35","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you want to hear what we did?","startTime":"08:35","endTime":"08:36","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I do.","startTime":"08:37","endTime":"08:37","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"One of the companies we had invested in put money into grants through this venture fund, quasi venture fund at unicef, was able to use satellite imagery to identify Various features and to do feature extraction of things like swamps or wetlands or even small puddles.","startTime":"08:39","endTime":"08:57","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And were using that in some countries to look at where malarial mosquitoes might be putting, laying their eggs.","startTime":"08:57","endTime":"09:03","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so that used imagery from Planet and from Maxar, that sort of like 30 centimeter.","startTime":"09:03","endTime":"09:08","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So pretty high resolution at the time, 2017, 95% cloudless.","startTime":"09:09","endTime":"09:14","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So pretty like fine grained stuff to figure out stuff on the ground where it is.","startTime":"09:14","endTime":"09:18","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And were also doing some work with drones and UAVs to have them do.","startTime":"09:18","endTime":"09:22","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Not vertical imagery, but kind of diagonal imagery to rectify satellite imagery.","startTime":"09:22","endTime":"09:26","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so we thought, could we use that satellite imagery to find schools?","startTime":"09:26","endTime":"09:29","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because that should be pretty easy.","startTime":"09:29","endTime":"09:30","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It turns out that schools actually look different in different parts of the world, but in contiguous parts of the world, they all look the same.","startTime":"09:30","endTime":"09:37","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So schools in Central Asia, there are only seven types of schools.","startTime":"09:37","endTime":"09:40","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They were all built on the kind of Soviet imprint and architecture.","startTime":"09:40","endTime":"09:43","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And if you can identify schools in Kazakhstan, you can do it in Uzbekistan, which is a machine learning problem and a training problem.","startTime":"09:43","endTime":"09:49","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we built a bunch of ML open source ML with some partners like Development Seed and UCLA and some other kind of partners, academic partners.","startTime":"09:49","endTime":"09:58","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And we had this pipeline of satellite imagery and we started to find schools and train basic open source ML defined schools.","startTime":"09:59","endTime":"10:07","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And we had kind of 95% true positives, which is okay.","startTime":"10:07","endTime":"10:10","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Now we're up to 99.5%.","startTime":"10:10","endTime":"10:12","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that was really neat and it showed us that were totally wrong.","startTime":"10:13","endTime":"10:17","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"When I said to Sharad, like, of course everybody knows where the schools are, we didn't.","startTime":"10:17","endTime":"10:21","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So when we did the mapping in Columbia, we took this satellite imagery and we found out of 43,000 schools that we have now in the database.","startTime":"10:21","endTime":"10:30","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And everybody can go.","startTime":"10:30","endTime":"10:31","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If you want to go to ProjectConnect World, you can go and see this live.","startTime":"10:31","endTime":"10:34","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So go to ProjectConnect World, you can click on Columbia and you'll see what I'm talking about.","startTime":"10:34","endTime":"10:39","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We found out of 43,000 schools that 6,000 of them that we'd identified from satellite imagery didn't exist at the national registrar.","startTime":"10:39","endTime":"10:45","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So like the government was working without a full deck of cards.","startTime":"10:46","endTime":"10:50","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it's not that nobody knew where that school was like somebody does in the district or the town, but it's not necessarily at the capital city.","startTime":"10:50","endTime":"10:55","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And we keep finding this in every country where we do mapping that.","startTime":"10:56","endTime":"10:58","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There's a disconnect between the government data about this very central building that is pretty important to society ostensibly, and what's actually There.","startTime":"10:58","endTime":"11:09","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so even that first piece of work has been incredible.","startTime":"11:09","endTime":"11:12","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We've mapped about 2.1 million schools and we still don't know what the denominator is.","startTime":"11:13","endTime":"11:17","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"11:18","endTime":"11:18","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We don't know how, we don't know how many schools there are in the world.","startTime":"11:18","endTime":"11:20","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And we've been doing this for four years, which is crazy.","startTime":"11:20","endTime":"11:23","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Sorry.","startTime":"11:24","endTime":"11:24","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that's like the very beginning of the story.","startTime":"11:24","endTime":"11:26","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's like there's a lot more, but that's where it started.","startTime":"11:26","endTime":"11:28","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's super cool.","startTime":"11:29","endTime":"11:30","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So, so where, how did you end up mapping these schools then?","startTime":"11:30","endTime":"11:34","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because if there are no common denominators, like you said, like you can't look at building types.","startTime":"11:34","endTime":"11:38","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I mean some countries you could, but in general, like, oh, you look at like stream of people like over time or how are you actually mapping this?","startTime":"11:39","endTime":"11:47","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"11:47","endTime":"11:47","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think the technical term is it's AI, magic blah.","startTime":"11:47","endTime":"11:50","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I'll give you like a slightly more technical view.","startTime":"11:50","endTime":"11:54","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We do a bunch of things.","startTime":"11:56","endTime":"11:57","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So one of the reasons that we're at UNICEF is because UNICEF has access to this massive labor force.","startTime":"11:57","endTime":"12:02","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We have people in every country in the world which, if you know, machine learning, the biggest problem is always annotation and training data and training sets, right?","startTime":"12:02","endTime":"12:12","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like that's the tough thing to get.","startTime":"12:12","endTime":"12:13","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So if you're going to map the school in Sudan, which we did before the war had started there, you need some pretty good ground truth data to train your agents on.","startTime":"12:14","endTime":"12:25","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We are able to deploy people using UNICEF's network so we can subcontract and we can say to people, go on a motorbike, go and find the school and either go to find, give us the centroid of the school or give us the four corner points of the school or whatever, just go and do a GPS notation, send that to us.","startTime":"12:25","endTime":"12:43","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we pay for that.","startTime":"12:43","endTime":"12:44","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And we would usually do, you know, 5 to 10% of what we government.","startTime":"12:45","endTime":"12:50","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Government will give us a number.","startTime":"12:50","endTime":"12:51","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They'll say we have 20,000 schools.","startTime":"12:51","endTime":"12:52","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we'll try to get 500 to 2,000 schools or something like that in different parts of the country.","startTime":"12:52","endTime":"12:59","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So scattered all over because the ones near an urban area look different from the ones far away.","startTime":"12:59","endTime":"13:03","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You get that feed into the ML, train it, and pretty quickly you're able to identify what schools look like.","startTime":"13:03","endTime":"13:09","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Now there's other stuff, there's other signal that you can add on top of that to fortify it.","startTime":"13:09","endTime":"13:13","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We don't really know, and this is why I said it's sort of a magic blah.","startTime":"13:14","endTime":"13:17","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You don't really know what The ML is picking up on.","startTime":"13:17","endTime":"13:19","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We believe this is our best guess from it.","startTime":"13:20","endTime":"13:23","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We believe it's things like there's a football pitch.","startTime":"13:23","endTime":"13:26","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Most schools have some playing ground, some area.","startTime":"13:26","endTime":"13:29","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"As you said, most schools have a queue of kids walking there in the morning, walking back in the afternoon.","startTime":"13:29","endTime":"13:34","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So depending on what time of day your satellite imagery is, you know, from, you can see that there are certain building shapes, as I said, like in Central Asia, that just represent a school, often a school or a prison, which is a weird thing about the education system, but, you know.","startTime":"13:34","endTime":"13:48","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Well, I mean, because you need some.","startTime":"13:49","endTime":"13:51","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I mean, I guess the building structure has.","startTime":"13:51","endTime":"13:53","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Does have some constraint, right, because you need to house a lot of people in.","startTime":"13:53","endTime":"13:56","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You got to keep them inside and make sure they get out.","startTime":"13:56","endTime":"13:59","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And, and so things like that are the.","startTime":"14:01","endTime":"14:03","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"All the tells that go into, feed into it.","startTime":"14:03","endTime":"14:05","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We also then work with partners who do some manual annotation as well.","startTime":"14:05","endTime":"14:09","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We've built some games for crowdsourcing.","startTime":"14:09","endTime":"14:12","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you may be familiar.","startTime":"14:12","endTime":"14:13","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"About 10 years ago, there was a malaria spot game where people could be waiting for their Starbucks coffee and they could flick left and right like swipe left on a malarial parasite.","startTime":"14:13","endTime":"14:22","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You could train the user.","startTime":"14:22","endTime":"14:23","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, but what are you doing when you're waiting for your coffee?","startTime":"14:23","endTime":"14:26","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I work from home, Chris.","startTime":"14:27","endTime":"14:29","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"This is back in the old days.","startTime":"14:30","endTime":"14:31","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They found that if you train people up on what a malarial parasite looks like, you could have, you know, I don't know, if you had 17 people look at the slide, it was as accurate as a doctor doing it so you could figure out malarial parasites.","startTime":"14:32","endTime":"14:44","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we did spill some games like that, like school or not kind of thing.","startTime":"14:44","endTime":"14:48","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Swipe left or swipe right on your school.","startTime":"14:48","endTime":"14:50","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so we've kind of built up these sets of tools to just get the physical data about where schools are.","startTime":"14:51","endTime":"14:56","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And if you look at that project connect that world map, you'll see a lot of countries have purple dots, which are just the physical locations.","startTime":"14:56","endTime":"15:02","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But that still didn't get us to Greg Wyler's question about how to turn the dots different colors.","startTime":"15:02","endTime":"15:07","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that's tough too.","startTime":"15:07","endTime":"15:09","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So tell me.","startTime":"15:10","endTime":"15:11","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So now we have some data set of schools, right?","startTime":"15:11","endTime":"15:14","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And we can correlate that with if they have connectivity, I presume, based by fiber lines where they are drawn, because they're probably better data on that.","startTime":"15:14","endTime":"15:23","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Well, actually, that's the next question, I guess.","startTime":"15:23","endTime":"15:25","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"How do you take it from.","startTime":"15:25","endTime":"15:26","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, we have a school.","startTime":"15:26","endTime":"15:28","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Do we even know if it has connectivity?","startTime":"15:28","endTime":"15:30","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And if it does have connectivity, what does it look like in terms of QoS and all that.","startTime":"15:30","endTime":"15:34","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So there are two steps between finding the school and figuring out actual traffic data.","startTime":"15:35","endTime":"15:43","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The first is exactly as you said, to figure out what's the rough umbrella of signal that it's under.","startTime":"15:43","endTime":"15:48","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so if you take GSM maps, so you can go to gsma, which is the kind of umbrella agency for all the mobile service providers, and you can request GSM data from them.","startTime":"15:48","endTime":"16:00","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G coverage.","startTime":"16:00","endTime":"16:03","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So every cell tower is registered in that database.","startTime":"16:03","endTime":"16:05","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, they won't give you the cell tower locations, but you can see like what's underneath a tower umbrella, basically.","startTime":"16:06","endTime":"16:11","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"16:12","endTime":"16:12","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And signal strength.","startTime":"16:12","endTime":"16:13","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you can kind of get range.","startTime":"16:13","endTime":"16:14","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Roughly, I presume, plus, minus.","startTime":"16:14","endTime":"16:16","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And you know, telephone operators are kind of cagey still about like what radio is on what mast, which they don't really need to be anymore, but it's sort of they consider protected information.","startTime":"16:16","endTime":"16:26","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Ten years ago, when we started doing the venture fund stuff, we couldn't even get tower locations.","startTime":"16:26","endTime":"16:31","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It was like that was a proprietary thing to be like, that's.","startTime":"16:31","endTime":"16:34","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Nobody can know.","startTime":"16:34","endTime":"16:34","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it's like, okay, why?","startTime":"16:34","endTime":"16:37","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because we're putting our tower there.","startTime":"16:37","endTime":"16:38","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Somebody else is going to put it one hill over and then they're going to take all our users away from us because they're super concerned about churn.","startTime":"16:38","endTime":"16:43","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right, right.","startTime":"16:43","endTime":"16:44","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That's a little less.","startTime":"16:44","endTime":"16:45","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Now everybody does tower sharing, so that's not really going to share anymore.","startTime":"16:45","endTime":"16:49","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And we actually get a lot of tower placement data from like partners like IHS Tower, which has a ton of masts in Africa, which they rent, you know, radio space out on to competitors.","startTime":"16:49","endTime":"16:59","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They give us their tower location data.","startTime":"16:59","endTime":"17:01","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We're able to process that and use it.","startTime":"17:01","endTime":"17:03","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But you can go to a service provider and you can be like, if I give you 5, 5 lat long points, can you tell me, you know, what umbrella they're under?","startTime":"17:03","endTime":"17:11","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Is it 2G, 3G, 4G?","startTime":"17:11","endTime":"17:13","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And they'll sort of do that for you.","startTime":"17:13","endTime":"17:14","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And there's some published maps that do that.","startTime":"17:14","endTime":"17:17","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then you can also go to big companies like Meta and if you have the right agreement with them, they'll also give you some coverage data.","startTime":"17:17","endTime":"17:23","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Now, none of this is live and none of it is really linked to the location itself.","startTime":"17:23","endTime":"17:28","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's just where an RF wave would hit.","startTime":"17:28","endTime":"17:32","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you're sort of like, if I'm on this point on the map, should I be able to get some frequency of something undocumented?","startTime":"17:32","endTime":"17:42","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay, yeah, but it doesn't feel like it.","startTime":"17:43","endTime":"17:45","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Exactly.","startTime":"17:45","endTime":"17:46","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"17:46","endTime":"17:46","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so a mountain being in the way is not an ideal condition.","startTime":"17:46","endTime":"17:48","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it's not necessarily captured on their coverage maps because those coverage maps are pretty much like the world is flat and there's no trees.","startTime":"17:48","endTime":"17:55","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You know, you're under our network, so but you can you get that map.","startTime":"17:55","endTime":"18:01","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And a lot of the countries that you'll see on Project Connect World have what we call, you know, proximal data or potential connectivity data that is not real time, that's not actually linking into the school.","startTime":"18:01","endTime":"18:12","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's just where the network should be.","startTime":"18:12","endTime":"18:14","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it's usually pretty good.","startTime":"18:15","endTime":"18:16","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's like pretty generous.","startTime":"18:16","endTime":"18:17","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There's a lot of coverage in the world, it's just there's not a lot of access.","startTime":"18:17","endTime":"18:20","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So still, As I said, 2 billion people don't have access, but many of them live under a cell signal of some sort.","startTime":"18:20","endTime":"18:26","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There's another question about fiber nodes, which I'll talk about in a little bit.","startTime":"18:27","endTime":"18:30","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But, but generally you can get like a pretty good cell plus signal map that's not super hard to generate, but that generates a lot of schools that look green because they are under a cell signal, but they're not connected.","startTime":"18:30","endTime":"18:45","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So the third thing we do, the most difficult thing is figuring out in real time whether a school is connected or not.","startTime":"18:45","endTime":"18:52","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"In order to do that, we do a bunch of things.","startTime":"18:52","endTime":"18:54","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So one thing we do is connect into governments network operations centers, if they have them, or depending on the kind of complexity of the government contracting, sometimes they'll have an ISP that's the government contractor that will have their own API that basically represents some of the data from their own network operation center.","startTime":"18:54","endTime":"19:16","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And if you're not familiar with network data that basically is ping, you get roughly ping data from a client and from the client details it'll spit back something so we can get some of that.","startTime":"19:16","endTime":"19:29","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Whether or not you trust that type of data is another question.","startTime":"19:29","endTime":"19:32","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we also have our own software probes that we can install that are chrome extensions that we can put on site that's behind the router.","startTime":"19:32","endTime":"19:39","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We'd love to do firmware like at the router, but at least like we can get it on some appliance in the school, a computer, laptop, whatever, and that pings back.","startTime":"19:40","endTime":"19:47","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we've got about 70 or 80,000 schools providing that real time data.","startTime":"19:47","endTime":"19:51","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So the first data point you get for the ISP is basically like ISP to the edge gateway essentially.","startTime":"19:51","endTime":"19:56","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Then then obviously you have packet loss and whatnot from that to the school.","startTime":"19:56","endTime":"19:59","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So like you want to have the end device experience.","startTime":"19:59","endTime":"20:02","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, I mean, I'm happy with either of them.","startTime":"20:02","endTime":"20:05","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's a.","startTime":"20:05","endTime":"20:06","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We have a huge argument on our team of like, is ping good enough for bandwidth?","startTime":"20:06","endTime":"20:11","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like for bandwidth monitoring?","startTime":"20:11","endTime":"20:12","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I believe it is for most of the stuff that we need to do.","startTime":"20:12","endTime":"20:16","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But this is like a religious argument on the team.","startTime":"20:16","endTime":"20:17","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's how.","startTime":"20:17","endTime":"20:18","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"20:18","endTime":"20:18","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So like, no, because it doesn't really give you throughput, like at the level that you need for real bandwidth monitoring.","startTime":"20:19","endTime":"20:24","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It doesn't give you any real traffic details.","startTime":"20:25","endTime":"20:26","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Ping is pretty brutal.","startTime":"20:26","endTime":"20:27","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But at least lets you.","startTime":"20:27","endTime":"20:29","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, yeah, it at least lets you know that there's something there.","startTime":"20:29","endTime":"20:32","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"20:32","endTime":"20:32","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so for a lot of the stuff that we're working on, like, I just need to know that there's a heartbeat.","startTime":"20:32","endTime":"20:36","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I don't need to know like the size of the patient body really.","startTime":"20:36","endTime":"20:39","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, it'd be great if I could.","startTime":"20:39","endTime":"20:40","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Now the other problem is the way that an ISP does their like, allocation of IP addresses may not be statically assigning them to schools.","startTime":"20:42","endTime":"20:52","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like they might just do a block.","startTime":"20:52","endTime":"20:53","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So they may be giving you pretty arbitrary stuff and who knows really what a third party provider puts in the data that they give to you.","startTime":"20:53","endTime":"21:00","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I like to have something that links a geolocation to, you know, to some ID in our database that can give me a signal from that.","startTime":"21:00","endTime":"21:10","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, I guess our appliance.","startTime":"21:10","endTime":"21:13","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There's a massive incentive for the ISP to overrepresent their performance against their bodies, right?","startTime":"21:13","endTime":"21:21","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Well, for sure.","startTime":"21:21","endTime":"21:22","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Especially if it's a public service contract where there usually are some uptime guarantees and things like that.","startTime":"21:22","endTime":"21:26","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"21:26","endTime":"21:27","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So if you are legally liable for stuff, you're gonna be probably pretty generous about what your uptime is.","startTime":"21:27","endTime":"21:34","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"For example.","startTime":"21:35","endTime":"21:36","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Not trying to point fingers, but you know.","startTime":"21:36","endTime":"21:38","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Well, yeah, it's good to cross check it, absolutely.","startTime":"21:39","endTime":"21:43","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But then that means sometimes you gotta get something installed at the school, right?","startTime":"21:43","endTime":"21:46","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that's the bummer of it, right?","startTime":"21:46","endTime":"21:47","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You gotta go to a school that probably didn't even have electricity a few years ago, that there may be only one computer on site.","startTime":"21:47","endTime":"21:53","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Cause maybe they're running just a, like a projector off of the thin

extension that we want to put on here and hopefully that gets done.","startTime":"21:59","endTime":"22:04","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But we've done that successfully.","startTime":"22:04","endTime":"22:05","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's in 80,000 schools.","startTime":"22:05","endTime":"22:06","speaker_name":"Chris

it.","startTime":"22:08","endTime":"22:11","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And they do it every four hours during the School

neat, right?","startTime":"22:18","endTime":"22:19","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean, that's because that's a trade off as well, right?","startTime":"22:20","endTime":"22:22","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Doing a band, if you have a very slim connection, you wouldn't want to eat up that

Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's, we're trying to get a community that has never had Internet and probably doesn't have electricity in their school to have the school be the node for the

community.","startTime":"22:48","endTime":"22:54","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What I mean by that is if you can get the public contract from the government to put the tower on top of the school, for example, say it's a cell tower or say it's like a radio receiver, you can propagate that signal through a WI FI antenna to the community for a few hundred meters for relatively low cost.","startTime":"22:55","endTime":"23:11","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You can do that after school hours.","startTime":"23:11","endTime":"23:13","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You can then create a WI FI hotspot that people can use for a lot of other things.","startTime":"23:13","endTime":"23:17","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And the school then becomes the hook that drags this connectivity out.","startTime":"23:17","endTime":"23:19","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But you create a public access point which gets more people to use the Internet, even people who aren't in school, which then gets me to my goal of having more people connected to positive, you know, software and technology and data that can help them with their lives.","startTime":"23:19","endTime":"23:33","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so for us, like, do I really care exactly what the throughput is for the school?","startTime":"23:33","endTime":"23:38","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"No.","startTime":"23:39","endTime":"23:39","speaker_name":"Chris

yellow and green.","startTime":"23:45","endTime":"23:49","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Green is like you're getting some juice.","startTime":"23:50","endTime":"23:52","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Red is there's nothing.","startTime":"23:53","endTime":"23:54","speaker_name":"Chris

it's.","startTime":"24:01","endTime":"24:02","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's so many orders of magnitude better than zero that you know, I'm happy even with

Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you found, so you looked at antennas, you figure out some kind of fiber links in the city or in the region.","startTime":"24:09","endTime":"24:17","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What other tools do you have at your disposal to kind of figure out or connect to the dots here?","startTime":"24:18","endTime":"24:22","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, well, so fibernotes are interesting.","startTime":"24:22","endTime":"24:24","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The itu.","startTime":"24:24","endTime":"24:25","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So the third part of my story.","startTime":"24:25","endTime":"24:27","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we got Sharad's thing done.","startTime":"24:27","endTime":"24:29","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We got Greg Weiler's thing done, and then we needed to get Doreen Bogdan Martin's thing done.","startTime":"24:29","endTime":"24:33","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"ITU has access to all of the fiber data and kind of infrastructure data for broadband.","startTime":"24:33","endTime":"24:40","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They run a thing called the Broadband Commission.","startTime":"24:40","endTime":"24:42","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They work on behalf of all the regulators of the world.","startTime":"24:42","endTime":"24:45","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so one of the things that's been really interesting over the last year is that we're able to start taking their data about fiber node location and fiber itself and starting to overlay that on the information that we have about school connectivity.","startTime":"24:46","endTime":"25:01","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Then you can see some pretty interesting stuff.","startTime":"25:01","endTime":"25:02","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, well, there's actually a lot of fiber that's only in Kenya.","startTime":"25:03","endTime":"25:07","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, something 95% of it is only 2 kilometers away from a school or less.","startTime":"25:07","endTime":"25:11","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it's like right there.","startTime":"25:11","endTime":"25:12","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But you don't really know that if you don't have that fiber map.","startTime":"25:13","endTime":"25:15","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So then you can get a provider like Liquid Telecom, which is a big East African isp, mno, mostly an isp, to kind of pop up off of that, off that fiber, pop up a hotspot directed to the school.","startTime":"25:15","endTime":"25:29","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And if you can have that, you can create efficiencies for planning.","startTime":"25:29","endTime":"25:33","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So the tools that you do, this map, the map is pretty important.","startTime":"25:33","endTime":"25:36","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But after the map, we have some infrastructure planning tools and also some financing tools that we bring in to help a government get their schools connected.","startTime":"25:37","endTime":"25:45","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I'd say that the map, though, is itself a really great starting point.","startTime":"25:45","endTime":"25:50","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So what we found in Kyrgyzstan was that just by doing the map, we showed that there was a whole bunch of schools in the middle of the country that the government thought had been connected.","startTime":"25:50","endTime":"25:59","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So they're like, we just did a big public procurement.","startTime":"25:59","endTime":"26:01","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"All the schools are connected.","startTime":"26:01","endTime":"26:02","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And we did the map and we saw these red dots right in the middle.","startTime":"26:02","endTime":"26:05","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It says, like, green to the end of the top bottom third, and green to the bottom of the top third, this swath in the middle.","startTime":"26:05","endTime":"26:11","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And like, why are those ones red?","startTime":"26:11","endTime":"26:13","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Turns out that the providers, they kind of contracted two providers and they both sort of stopped in what they thought was the middle, but it wasn't actually the middle.","startTime":"26:13","endTime":"26:20","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It was just the end of the third.","startTime":"26:20","endTime":"26:22","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we're like, wow, great.","startTime":"26:22","endTime":"26:24","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There's a whole bunch of the country that's not connected.","startTime":"26:24","endTime":"26:26","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Showed it to the prime minister.","startTime":"26:26","endTime":"26:27","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"He saw it and he's like, what's going on here?","startTime":"26:28","endTime":"26:31","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I was like, I don't know, dude.","startTime":"26:31","endTime":"26:32","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, that's a you problem, not a me problem.","startTime":"26:32","endTime":"26:34","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But, you know, this is just a map.","startTime":"26:34","endTime":"26:36","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And they immediately redid the bid.","startTime":"26:36","endTime":"26:38","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So they did a new bid and they got a new company to come in to actually cover that intermediate intermediary space.","startTime":"26:38","endTime":"26:45","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it lowered the price of gigabytes by 55% for schools.","startTime":"26:45","endTime":"26:49","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Wow.","startTime":"26:49","endTime":"26:49","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So just the map itself, like, created some market dynamics which brought pricing down because it brought in a new isp.","startTime":"26:49","endTime":"26:55","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So the map is important.","startTime":"26:57","endTime":"26:59","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That being said, the things that happen after the map are pretty neat as well.","startTime":"26:59","endTime":"27:02","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And we've helped governments now, like, arrange loans from some of these big banks, like the World bank or Islamic development banks, and financing, you know, players that can give them cheap loans for infrastructure.","startTime":"27:02","endTime":"27:13","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And we've also helped to talk about, like, regulatory structures in governments that could open up money for public infrastructure.","startTime":"27:13","endTime":"27:21","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So governments often have these universal service funds or universal access funds that are taxed revenue from network operators.","startTime":"27:21","endTime":"27:28","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It goes into a pool that's supposed to connect poor people.","startTime":"27:29","endTime":"27:32","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And spoiler alert, it never does.","startTime":"27:32","endTime":"27:34","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It gets used for other infrastructure projects.","startTime":"27:34","endTime":"27:36","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we also help work with the regulatory side to open those up.","startTime":"27:37","endTime":"27:40","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So, I mean, I guess.","startTime":"27:41","endTime":"27:42","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Sorry, that was like a lot.","startTime":"27:42","endTime":"27:43","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's like giga in, you know, four minutes.","startTime":"27:43","endTime":"27:45","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There's a.","startTime":"27:45","endTime":"27:45","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There's a whole lot in there.","startTime":"27:45","endTime":"27:46","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There's a lot to unpack.","startTime":"27:47","endTime":"27:48","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"27:48","endTime":"27:48","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I think that the interesting part is, one of the interesting things that we ned out last time I saw you in person was about how you can kind of reduce the cost of all this because you have kind of a blueprint of how it should look like for both what it should cost.","startTime":"27:48","endTime":"28:02","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because I would imagine in a lot of these countries that are, I guess it goes without saying that a lot of them are very corrupt and a lot of people trying to reap the benefit of all these money, like, diverged elsewhere, I guess.","startTime":"28:02","endTime":"28:15","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so talk to me a bit about, have you kind of solved that problem with both fighting corruption and reducing the actual cost for the school?","startTime":"28:16","endTime":"28:24","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"At the end of the day.","startTime":"28:24","endTime":"28:25","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I believe that every country is corrupt in its own way.","startTime":"28:29","endTime":"28:35","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Every bureaucracy is corrupt, everything, you know, these things, all corrupt.","startTime":"28:35","endTime":"28:39","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I mean that in a very technical sense, that they are corrupted, by which I mean that they're inefficient or they're rusted or they're broken or they're old.","startTime":"28:39","endTime":"28:47","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I very firmly believe that data is the solution to that open data fixes that.","startTime":"28:47","endTime":"28:53","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's like the way you clean the rust off of pipes.","startTime":"28:53","endTime":"28:55","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"When we look at the policy of broadband in the United States, for example, it's terrible.","startTime":"28:56","endTime":"29:03","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If you look at indigenous lands, if you look at, like, Navajo land, For example, you'll see almost no connectivity.","startTime":"29:03","endTime":"29:10","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The ability to set up like local open networks is zero.","startTime":"29:10","endTime":"29:14","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"In the US, a few big telcos have the lock in on it, and that's because they spent an enormous amount of money on policy and advocacy, lobbying.","startTime":"29:14","endTime":"29:23","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, this stuff goes throughout the world.","startTime":"29:23","endTime":"29:25","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I really don't like it.","startTime":"29:26","endTime":"29:28","speaker_name":"Chris

me.","startTime":"29:30","endTime":"29:32","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If you have data about it, as you're saying, you suddenly create a picture that you're not arguing like against a company, you're just showing the truth.","startTime":"29:32","endTime":"29:40","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So if you look at the Project Connect map of

map.","startTime":"29:44","endTime":"29:47","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I can just show you that there's like a whole bunch of the country that's

on the side of poor people, which I'm.","startTime":"29:57","endTime":"30:03","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay, I think that's like a very reasonable place to be positioned from like a philosophical perspective.","startTime":"30:03","endTime":"30:08","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But you're also using data to show the potential opportunity.","startTime":"30:09","endTime":"30:12","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So when you show that red map, you know, red and green map, an isp, a smart isp, a micro

made.","startTime":"30:12","endTime":"30:28","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They could see where they could position their towers or their assets, you know, or do their own

up 20,000 customers really fast.","startTime":"31:18","endTime":"31:24","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I think at the ground level, those two are really interesting

yeah, I mean, I think that there's a tremendous amount of innovation happening in these smaller providers and that if you could, you know, often they're lacking capital to go a little bit bigger, so

either leave earlier or just do more.","startTime":"33:40","endTime":"33:42","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But we also saw that if you connect all the schools in Sierra

powerful.","startTime":"36:05","endTime":"36:14","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It means that also schools could have their ownership of their own data.","startTime":"36:14","endTime":"36:17","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And you could update it, as we do with our current data on Project Connect, which is all in

neat.","startTime":"36:53","endTime":"36:54","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you're like, so that's the.","startTime":"36:54","endTime":"36:55","speaker_name":"Chris

of payment architecture.","startTime":"37:01","endTime":"37:04","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And we're now doing payments in crypto in a few

connectivity.","startTime":"37:09","endTime":"37:14","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then the third layer is like, if schools are objects and they can then pay things, and we can monitor contracts, all these complicated contracts that governments do, we can monitor those on chain.","startTime":"37:14","endTime":"37:24","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Can you write smart contracts to pay automatically?","startTime":"37:24","endTime":"37:26","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And the

cool.","startTime":"37:34","endTime":"37:35","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then the last layer on top of it all, after you've done all that, is can you create a marketplace around this where the connectivity itself becomes sort of tokenized, where you could exchange gigabytes, where Victor or Sarah in After Hours, maybe they're not using it for free, maybe they're paying a little bit for it, but the school gets that money back.","startTime":"37:35","endTime":"37:55","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And they get it back because

Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"He gets to access it.","startTime":"38:06","endTime":"38:07","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And there are mechanisms for doing all of this in the blockchain world.","startTime":"38:07","endTime":"38:11","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There are protocols that are kind of natively close to this type of stuff.","startTime":"38:11","endTime":"38:15","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And we're able to play with those, to use those and to look at like rolling them out really globally, which is very exciting to me.","startTime":"38:15","endTime":"38:21","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's super cool.","startTime":"38:23","endTime":"38:23","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So how does it.","startTime":"38:23","endTime":"38:24","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So this space, you know, a Lot more than I do about mobile banking in particular in Africa.","startTime":"38:24","endTime":"38:30","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"38:31","endTime":"38:31","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Where they leapfrogged a lot of credit cards and bank accounts.","startTime":"38:31","endTime":"38:35","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Where it's mobile banking is, it is phone banking essentially.","startTime":"38:35","endTime":"38:39","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"38:39","endTime":"38:39","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"How, how do you see these two things kind of connected together?","startTime":"38:39","endTime":"38:43","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Are they competing or synergetic or how.","startTime":"38:43","endTime":"38:46","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Do you see that it's totally market differentiated like it.","startTime":"38:46","endTime":"38:50","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it depends on the regulations from the government about both CBDCs, their central bank digital currencies, like how do they see that and their fintech stack as it exists now.","startTime":"38:50","endTime":"39:02","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So like a country like Safaricom, a country like Kenya which has Safaricom has a huge amount of their like national liquidity in the Safaricom bank account.","startTime":"39:02","endTime":"39:09","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's their mobile money account and people use M Pesa they may be less willing to experiment and in fact they're, I think their crypto stuff was around $8 billion last year but is down from 16 billion the year before.","startTime":"39:09","endTime":"39:22","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So there's a big drop but still like a lot of that's remittances.","startTime":"39:22","endTime":"39:26","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But then you look at a country like Nigeria where you've got tens of billions of dollars of crypto activity going on and there's a sandbox, kind of regulated sandbox that's being built up by the government and there's not this like one company that owns the whole fintech stack.","startTime":"39:27","endTime":"39:41","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it really, it's really varying.","startTime":"39:41","endTime":"39:44","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then you have smaller countries that don't have the capacity to do the regulatory stuff at all and they're kind of looking and watching and looking for help and we can provide some of that.","startTime":"39:44","endTime":"39:51","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we support governments in there.","startTime":"39:51","endTime":"39:54","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And something that I love doing, talking to central banks about kind of what the CBDC landscape looks like versus the open source kind of more permissionless blockchain which I'm a proponent of ecosystem and so offering some pathways to grow their own economies, ecosystems just by like learning about really educational, educating their own governments.","startTime":"39:54","endTime":"40:17","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"40:17","endTime":"40:18","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Their own national actors.","startTime":"40:18","endTime":"40:20","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But so I think the answer to your question is a lot of it's going to be picked up by network operators and this is going to be just native part of a network operator stack in the same way they have their billing, they built their billing stuff around.","startTime":"40:20","endTime":"40:32","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean the way that they monetize mobile money basically runs on the same engineering stack that SMS runs on.","startTime":"40:34","endTime":"40:40","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's just like a little bit more sophisticated.","startTime":"40:40","endTime":"40:42","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"40:42","endTime":"40:42","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's just like billing on top of that.","startTime":"40:42","endTime":"40:43","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I think they'll do something similar with crypto but it offers a type of Interoperability across network operators and then to other industries that they don't have with mobile money, it's like a lot more fluid.","startTime":"40:43","endTime":"40:55","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so I think you'll see a lot of really interesting growth happen in emerging markets as the definition of what a network operator is changes.","startTime":"40:55","endTime":"41:01","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And they become service providers for a lot of other software packages like education, like health and so on.","startTime":"41:01","endTime":"41:09","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And they can actually pay for that content and they can track and monetize it because blockchain gives you the ability to do that content monetization.","startTime":"41:10","endTime":"41:16","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's like the long term.","startTime":"41:18","endTime":"41:19","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think that's like the long term M and O play for a smart operator.","startTime":"41:19","endTime":"41:23","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"41:23","endTime":"41:23","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So going back to the mapping process and like connecting schools in general, what is the most meaningful deployment to you that you've seen so far on this journey?","startTime":"41:24","endTime":"41:35","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"There are, I mean, so I love the big national scale stuff because I think that's really important.","startTime":"41:36","endTime":"41:43","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We have seen countries like Kazakhstan reach almost full, you know, full connectivity.","startTime":"41:44","endTime":"41:50","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Kyrgyzstan has now 99 connectivity.","startTime":"41:50","endTime":"41:53","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I also love some of the stories of very remote communities that just never had access before.","startTime":"41:54","endTime":"42:00","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So there are like 30 schools in Kyrgyzstan which even after we did that mapping stuff there like this, 30 schools were.","startTime":"42:01","endTime":"42:07","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They're so far up in the mountains that they don't even have like an FM signal.","startTime":"42:07","endTime":"42:10","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They don't have, there's no radio.","startTime":"42:11","endTime":"42:13","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"These schools, these villages are so disconnected and because of the mapping and because of a guy named Talent Sultanav in Kyrgyzstan and he works with isoc, which is the Internet society of Kyrgyzstan, he's connected these 30 communities, these 30 villages, and for the first time ever, they have the ability to be part of like a global discussion.","startTime":"42:13","endTime":"42:32","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that's super meaningful too.","startTime":"42:32","endTime":"42:34","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then, you know, every time I talk to teachers in schools, that teachers tell us that the connectivity has changed their way of working and the quality of their experience, which I think you can translate into anybody having the Internet.","startTime":"42:36","endTime":"42:49","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So really interestingly, like we don't do any of the ed tech stuff, right?","startTime":"42:49","endTime":"42:52","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We don't do like what kind of software you put in the school or do you do tablets or laptops?","startTime":"42:52","endTime":"42:57","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's just not our thing.","startTime":"42:57","endTime":"42:58","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We just kind of get the traffic to the router basically.","startTime":"42:58","endTime":"43:02","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We don't do internal like land shaping, we don't do any of that building up.","startTime":"43:03","endTime":"43:07","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But we had a teacher in Kenya, this teacher named Paris.","startTime":"43:07","endTime":"43:10","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"She was the head teacher of a school called Norkopan in Kenya.","startTime":"43:10","endTime":"43:17","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's like 35 kilometers outside of Nairobi.","startTime":"43:17","endTime":"43:19","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"She said she's like, this was amazing.","startTime":"43:20","endTime":"43:22","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So Having Internet gave us like kids exam scores went up.","startTime":"43:22","endTime":"43:25","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Scores went up 8%, 9% just in a semester of having this.","startTime":"43:26","endTime":"43:29","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's good.","startTime":"43:29","endTime":"43:30","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Kids attendance went up by 10% because, like, it's interesting, it's more interesting for them to be a classroom where there's this thing.","startTime":"43:30","endTime":"43:35","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But she's like.","startTime":"43:35","endTime":"43:35","speaker_name":"Chris

Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I also would have to travel every day to this, you know, every week to the town, which is like a little while away, and put in these scores and attendance and come back.","startTime":"43:38","endTime":"43:47","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that took me an hour every week for just no reason.","startTime":"43:47","endTime":"43:49","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I'd have to pay the Internet cafe a little bit of money and I don't have to do that anymore because I can do my admin work from school.","startTime":"43:49","endTime":"43:54","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it saves me an hour every week plus a little bit of my own money.","startTime":"43:55","endTime":"43:58","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Imagine that.","startTime":"43:59","endTime":"43:59","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, imagine having back, I don't know, 5% of your time, 10% of your time because you're admin.","startTime":"43:59","endTime":"44:06","speaker_name":"Chris

even think about it.","startTime":"44:07","endTime":"44:10","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I love, I mean, I love those types of stories and then I like the

I'm just gonna put my laptop.","startTime":"55:58","endTime":"56:09","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, I find it much easier

something.","startTime":"56:18","endTime":"56:21","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I described most of it sent into ChatGPT.","startTime":"56:21","endTime":"56:24","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It laid it out for me.","startTime":"56:25","endTime":"56:26","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I did like two more revs of that and I had a perfectly workable thing that I was actually using, you know, chatgpt as a command line for transcription and that was great.","startTime":"56:26","endTime":"56:36","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so in like a year it'll be doing that for PowerPoints.","startTime":"56:37","endTime":"56:39","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And what do I do anymore?","startTime":"56:39","endTime":"56:41","speaker_name":"Chris

story.","startTime":"56:56","endTime":"56:57","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But I did, I've done some coding with ChatGPT and it's pretty terrible today.","startTime":"56:57","endTime":"57:01","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It gets you started pretty fast and it can do like, it can code across modules in Python.","startTime":"57:02","endTime":"57:06","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I was like playing with it the other day and like it can maintain state a little bit.","startTime":"57:06","endTime":"57:10","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"57:10","endTime":"57:10","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Which was surprising to me.","startTime":"57:11","endTime":"57:12","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But it breaks really quickly.","startTime":"57:13","endTime":"57:14","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But yeah, I mean you put it.","startTime":"57:14","endTime":"57:16","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You can see the first 15% and then you're like, cool.","startTime":"57:16","endTime":"57:18","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Now I can do the rest of it.","startTime":"57:18","endTime":"57:19","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I think your point still holds though.","startTime":"57:19","endTime":"57:21","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like, I think it's generational thing.","startTime":"57:21","endTime":"57:23","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"PCs or laptops is kind of a thing of the

water.","startTime":"57:30","endTime":"57:34","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But also look at the, look at like the resources that a laptop takes both to manufacture

right.","startTime":"57:46","endTime":"57:48","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, so I got a few things I want to cover more, which is one of them is open 5G and SDR is a big part in what's going on in the telco world right now.","startTime":"57:49","endTime":"58:01","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Project like Magma or the OpenSD

from your vantage point?","startTime":"58:06","endTime":"58:11","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I have to say, like, it's a regulatory game and I'm not a regulator.","startTime":"58:11","endTime":"58:16","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Our partner.","startTime":"58:16","endTime":"58:16","speaker_name":"Chris

Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I can give you my very limited perspective on it, which is that I think that the whole regulatory landscape about Spectrum, around spectrum licensing needs to be rethought.","startTime":"58:23","endTime":"58:32","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think that there is big potential for open 5G in the same way there is potential for TV white space.","startTime":"58:33","endTime":"58:40","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But it's a licensing and regulatory question.","startTime":"58:41","endTime":"58:43","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So if you can't get a government to give you dynamic licensing for spectrum allocation, then you're pretty limited on what you can do with spectrum.","startTime":"58:44","endTime":"58:54","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like that's kind of a defined thing, right?","startTime":"58:54","endTime":"58:56","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Of course.","startTime":"58:56","endTime":"58:57","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So like Magma was great because Magma provides software driven backend to do a lot of this stuff.","startTime":"58:57","endTime":"59:02","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But if, yeah, if from the national level the regulator isn't super behind it.","startTime":"59:02","endTime":"59:06","speaker_name":"Chris

Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"59:16","endTime":"59:17","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I mean what I find fascinating about is the commoditization of the telco stack which has been owned by a handful of companies for the last 20 or plus years.","startTime":"59:17","endTime":"59:28","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I think that's super interesting because that can potentially drive down deployment costs by order of magnitude.","startTime":"59:28","endTime":"59:34","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I agree.","startTime":"59:34","endTime":"59:35","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And some of the stuff that I've described with our Depin stack is an attempt to provoke activity in layers of that telco stack without being too aggressive and trying to take over.","startTime":"59:35","endTime":"59:45","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You know, there are a few providers of billing backends and billing software.","startTime":"59:45","endTime":"59:48","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There are a few providers of these different pieces and like you don't want to antagonize anybody but you can provide alternatives that they that are open source and that are licensed in a way that they can't, you know, commercialize and proprietize.","startTime":"59:48","endTime":"59:59","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They can commercialize them but.","startTime":"59:59","endTime":"01:00:00","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I think that there's a lot there.","startTime":"01:00:01","endTime":"01:00:03","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think interoperability is key and I think once you have more interoperability you have more flexibility on for example spectrum allocation because people feel more comfortable with it and you can do that dynamic stuff.","startTime":"01:00:03","endTime":"01:00:13","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So during peak hours you can give a block to somebody and then take it back.","startTime":"01:00:13","endTime":"01:00:17","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But you can't do any of that if things are locked in three different providers, silos and backends.","startTime":"01:00:17","endTime":"01:00:22","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And you can't cross Bill, for example.","startTime":"01:00:22","endTime":"01:00:24","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, CBRS is probably only spectrum that's still, that's properly open around the

scale.","startTime":"01:00:29","endTime":"01:00:33","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, like the

100%.","startTime":"01:00:39","endTime":"01:00:40","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That's where it all

your.","startTime":"01:01:16","endTime":"01:01:18","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"View is on that it actually solves a problem and it's not very expensive and the

anything.","startTime":"01:01:33","endTime":"01:01:35","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like helped, that money helped build the open source map that we use.","startTime":"01:01:35","endTime":"01:01:40","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it's not linked to like any, you know, we don't have to use any certain technology for anything.","startTime":"01:01:40","endTime":"01:01:45","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The what we see in most countries is that you need a mix of technologies in order to connect everybody.","startTime":"01:01:47","endTime":"01:01:54","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And LEOs themselves don't do it all.","startTime":"01:01:54","endTime":"01:01:57","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Fiber does a lot of it and fiber does a lot of it.","startTime":"01:01:57","endTime":"01:01:59","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Well, high bandwidth radio does a lot of it pretty well too.","startTime":"01:01:59","endTime":"01:02:04","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like 5G is pretty good for a lot of use cases and satellites are good for when you can't get the other two.","startTime":"01:02:04","endTime":"01:02:09","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, they're also much cheaper than, and in some cases the only option rather than laying fiber or kind of putting up a mast.","startTime":"01:02:09","endTime":"01:02:20","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So in those villages in Kyrgyzstan that I

satellites.","startTime":"01:02:28","endTime":"01:02:29","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Same in a desert area where it's far away.","startTime":"01:02:29","endTime":"01:02:32","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So satellites solve a lot of

broadly about the LEO industry, not about anyone in specific.","startTime":"01:03:04","endTime":"01:03:07","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So this is not about Starlink, but I think that governments need to have a policy for how they bring in a new contender against the existing mnos and how they regulate that fairly.","startTime":"01:03:07","endTime":"01:03:17","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So any LEO should be offered a smooth regulatory pathway to access a certain amount of

without like excessive tax and excise and they should be allowed to play in the market, but there should be guarantees for the provision of public connectivity that protect pricing.","startTime":"01:03:26","endTime":"01:03:37","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So my biggest worry with LEOs is they come in with extraordinarily low pricing on certain assets and they increase them arbitrarily over time very quickly.","startTime":"01:03:37","endTime":"01:03:46","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And there's nothing

everybody.","startTime":"01:03:59","endTime":"01:04:01","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But that for public contracts that are written with public money you have some long lasting capacity to not be totally upended if something goes wrong or is change on the part of the provider.","startTime":"01:04:01","endTime":"01:04:13","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Secondly, the hardware needs to be open access like terminals can't be linked only to one provider, I believe because if you have that, you can't reuse it.","startTime":"01:04:13","endTime":"01:04:22","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If that company goes out of business and everybody's going to say we're never going to go

anything.","startTime":"01:05:38","endTime":"01:05:39","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There still are countries where that exists that just think the Internet is

experience.","startTime":"01:05:44","endTime":"01:05:47","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I'm obviously like I'm a huge proponent of open software, open protocols, open hardware.","startTime":"01:05:47","endTime":"01:05:52","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like I really don't like that from a genetic point of view.","startTime":"01:05:52","endTime":"01:05:56","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's also just dangerous.","startTime":"01:05:57","endTime":"01:05:59","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I don't love that.","startTime":"01:05:59","endTime":"01:06:01","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think that the other thing that I'm kind of always nervous about is like locally cached content, which is sort of similar, like, oh, let's just cache it all here and then we're going to control the cache.","startTime":"01:06:02","endTime":"01:06:11","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I know it lowers kind of consumption costs, but it also creates these bottlenecks, these choke points for control.","startTime":"01:06:11","endTime":"01:06:17","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I think that these are things that need to be like, the more open you are on the network, the better you are able to have discussions about this stuff.","startTime":"01:06:19","endTime":"01:06:28","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The more you create these pockets of closure, the less that conversation even has to happen.","startTime":"01:06:28","endTime":"01:06:32","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So one of the people that I

like, infrastructure that can be used for other things.","startTime":"01:06:41","endTime":"01:06:49","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So there are like these big fiber rings that run between universities called nrens, which are national research and education networks that are like unused fiber basically in a lot of cases that can be used to propagate good stuff without getting that kind of proprietary lock in.","startTime":"01:06:49","endTime":"01:07:06","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And Steve talks a lot about how these types of networks can be used, and I think he's a great person.","startTime":"01:07:06","endTime":"01:07:12","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"He also has been talking a lot about

because I think that's something that I would make.","startTime":"01:07:17","endTime":"01:07:21","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Guess would make a lot of states nervous is when you have a fiber line into the country, essentially you can and put constraints on that.","startTime":"01:07:21","endTime":"01:07:31","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"However, if that goes up in space, you have zero control over what ingress or egress.","startTime":"01:07:32","endTime":"01:07:36","speaker_name":"Viktor

Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"01:07:42","endTime":"01:07:42","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"In which case you're fine because you're still trunking it like locally.","startTime":"01:07:42","endTime":"01:07:46","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so in that case you're just providing like a dispersion vector for a local pipe.","startTime":"01:07:46","endTime":"01:07:53","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you.","startTime":"01:07:54","endTime":"01:07:54","speaker_name":"Chris

the.","startTime":"01:07:58","endTime":"01:08:00","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like a network operator sovereignty technically ends 10 kilometers from the border, essentially.","startTime":"01:08:01","endTime":"01:08:06","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So like, you don't see a lot of masts in most countries closer than 5, 10 km from a border.","startTime":"01:08:06","endTime":"01:08:13","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's a, it's a gentle person's agreement.","startTime":"01:08:13","endTime":"01:08:15","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it's not written in, you know, in blood anywhere.","startTime":"01:08:15","endTime":"01:08:17","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But that's just kind of how it's been.","startTime":"01:08:17","endTime":"01:08:19","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that's.","startTime":"01:08:19","endTime":"01:08:19","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You don't get interference from two different MNOs.","startTime":"01:08:19","endTime":"01:08:22","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so like that's.","startTime":"01:08:24","endTime":"01:08:25","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Governments try to protect their sovereignty, but the world has just changed and

that.","startTime":"01:08:34","endTime":"01:08:36","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think one of the, you know, most difficult things to watch has been over the last few months with the Israeli bombardment of Gaza, watching the Internet change there.","startTime":"01:08:36","endTime":"01:08:48","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean, you've got Internet totally cut off and you can't get Internet access in Gaza now, which means that, you know, so there you have a case of a government like actually cutting off another people's access to this fundamental thing in addition to bombing, you know, a lot of bombing and deaths.","startTime":"01:08:48","endTime":"01:09:05","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That makes it very hard to under, you know, to imagine what the future world looks like when everybody's going to be trying to cut off other people's access to information.","startTime":"01:09:05","endTime":"01:09:13","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Again, I have some biases towards how decentralized networks fix some of that, but that's probably a longer conversation.","startTime":"01:09:14","endTime":"01:09:21","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, no, I was just kind of curious if you've seen any of that in your deployments at Giga.","startTime":"01:09:21","endTime":"01:09:26","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"If they've been like, yeah, we're happy to provide Internet.","startTime":"01:09:26","endTime":"01:09:30","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"However, these are the rules of

have.","startTime":"01:09:38","endTime":"01:09:41","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We only provide the raw bandwidth.","startTime":"01:09:41","endTime":"01:09:44","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We did see as soon as the bombing of Gaza started, we connected 70 schools in Palestine and they had the live connectivity thing.","startTime":"01:09:44","endTime":"01:09:51","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And we did see them go from green to black as the bombing started.","startTime":"01:09:52","endTime":"01:09:55","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we could watch that kind of stuff.","startTime":"01:09:55","endTime":"01:09:56","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But we haven't had a government tell us not to provision something because at the end of the day they hold the contract with the service provider.","startTime":"01:09:56","endTime":"01:10:03","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it's really up to the government to dictate what goes in that service package.","startTime":"01:10:03","endTime":"01:10:08","speaker_name":"Chris Fabian","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Got it.","startTime":"01:10:08","endTime":"01:10:09","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"This has been super secret.","startTime":"01:10:09","endTime":"01:10:11","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think we could go on for another hour or two at least, but I think that we have to
