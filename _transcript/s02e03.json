largely.","startTime":"00:08","endTime":"00:12","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I guess before we dive into what Chainguard is and all the juicy details on how you do security, maybe first let's talk about you.","startTime":"00:12","endTime":"00:22","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like, your resume reads like a who's who of tech.","startTime":"00:22","endTime":"00:25","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You're from Austin, proud Austin, as far as I'm aware.","startTime":"00:25","endTime":"00:28","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And let's just maybe give the audience a kind of a view of who you are and your backstory.","startTime":"00:28","endTime":"00:33","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, you bet.","startTime":"00:33","endTime":"00:34","speaker_name":"Dustin

Texas A and M University, computer engineering degree.","startTime":"00:37","endTime":"00:41","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Moved to Austin for a very specific purpose, which was to work at IBM on Linux.","startTime":"00:41","endTime":"00:47","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"In the very early days, late 90s, early 2000s, IBM was one of the first companies that would pay people to work on open source software.","startTime":"00:47","endTime":"00:55","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I love that and certainly built an early part of my career around Linux and the Linux Technology center, worked on the security team.","startTime":"00:55","endTime":"01:04","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I spent eight years at IBM.","startTime":"01:05","endTime":"01:08","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"In fact, one of those years I was on site at Red hat in Boston 2005, long before IBM and Red Hat became one thing.","startTime":"01:08","endTime":"01:16","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"After eight good years at IBM, I joined Canonical, a very small, scrappy Canonical that was just building its first server, Ubuntu.","startTime":"01:18","endTime":"01:27","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The, the server edition that was 2008.","startTime":"01:27","endTime":"01:30","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Time frame, which was a 704ish, was the first server.","startTime":"01:30","endTime":"01:35","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"804 was the really the first time we had a, a real, you know,

first real server and went straight to the cloud, you know, so like we skipped hardware.","startTime":"01:45","endTime":"01:56","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It was kind of interesting.","startTime":"01:56","endTime":"01:57","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The strategy then was Amazon was, AWS was just spinning up.","startTime":"01:57","endTime":"02:02","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So yeah, I actually left Canonical and joined a startup that had built itself around an open source project that I had co authored called ecryptfs.","startTime":"02:02","endTime":"02:13","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It was in the security space, an encrypted file system that we used in Ubuntu to encrypt home directories.","startTime":"02:13","endTime":"02:20","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"In the very early days of Ubuntu, I would say notably were encrypting home directories in Ubuntu before disk encryption in either Windows or Mac was a thing or default.","startTime":"02:21","endTime":"02:35","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And now I think it's pretty standard to expect to encrypt your data.","startTime":"02:36","endTime":"02:40","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I think we did something pretty remarkable there in the early days of the Ubuntu desktop.","startTime":"02:41","endTime":"02:46","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Anyway, this little company called Gazing was built around an encryption module that encrypted first MySQL databases.","startTime":"02:46","endTime":"02:54","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The founders actually raised a round of venture capital funding and then hired a CEO and hired myself as cto and we had a really interesting fun run encrypting basically healthcare data in the 20111213 time frame, right around when the HIPAA compliance was going into effect.","startTime":"02:55","endTime":"03:16","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Remind me to circle back to that when we get to Chain Guard because there's an important tie in there.","startTime":"03:17","endTime":"03:22","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That company actually was acquired by Cloudera.","startTime":"03:23","endTime":"03:26","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I did not go to Cloudera.","startTime":"03:26","endTime":"03:27","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I went actually back to Canonical and led product for a number of years.","startTime":"03:27","endTime":"03:31","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I did two stints at Canonical, four years the first time and then six years the second time around and you know, 10 years total.","startTime":"03:31","endTime":"03:40","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Really proud of everything, you know, that we build at Ubuntu.","startTime":"03:40","endTime":"03:43","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I still, you know, celebrate the Ubuntu Schweig and fun memorabilia.","startTime":"03:43","endTime":"03:50","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"After Ubuntu, I joined Google and worked on Kubernetes.","startTime":"03:50","endTime":"03:54","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I was a product manager bringing basically Kubernetes on prem.","startTime":"03:54","endTime":"03:58","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I worked on the operating system and the Kubernetes worker nodes, which was, you know, important part of running Kubernetes on Prem for Google prior to the Anthos product.","startTime":"03:58","endTime":"04:10","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But basically that became the on prem part of Anthos.","startTime":"04:10","endTime":"04:13","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"After Google, I spent a couple of years in financial services.","startTime":"04:14","endTime":"04:17","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It was interesting.","startTime":"04:17","endTime":"04:18","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I really saw a wave of change coming in the financial services industry around just modernizing infrastructure and tech.","startTime":"04:18","endTime":"04:26","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Both Canonical and Google had a lot of customers that were looking at Kubernetes and open source and cloud and scale.","startTime":"04:27","endTime":"04:34","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I first joined a private startup that provided clearing and custody services as an API called Apex, and then joined one of our customers, which was Goldman Sachs, who had built one of Apex's customers rather, who had built basically a consumer bank on top of that.","startTime":"04:35","endTime":"04:54","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Took some time off after that and got in touch with some old friends, the founders of Chainguard, and they recruited me to join early on and help build out the engineering team.","startTime":"04:55","endTime":"05:05","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I think I'd wrap that with saying of 25 years of work, I've spent half of that in three of the world's biggest companies, Google, IBM and Goldman Sachs.","startTime":"05:05","endTime":"05:16","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The other half in growth mode startups.","startTime":"05:16","endTime":"05:18","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I've also spent half of that in engineering and half of that in product management.","startTime":"05:19","endTime":"05:23","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I've kind of had a foot in both engineering and product camps and both startups and big public company.","startTime":"05:24","endTime":"05:30","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Awesome, awesome.","startTime":"05:31","endTime":"05:32","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That's a lot to unpack there.","startTime":"05:32","endTime":"05:35","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I guess that's a natural segue.","startTime":"05:35","endTime":"05:38","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Over to Chainguard, which is your current employer.","startTime":"05:38","endTime":"05:41","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I guess for those not familiar with chainguard, what's the elevator pitch?","startTime":"05:41","endTime":"05:45","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What's the story like?","startTime":"05:45","endTime":"05:46","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"How do you describe it?","startTime":"05:46","endTime":"05:48","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Briefly?","startTime":"05:48","endTime":"05:48","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, we call ourselves the safe source for open Source.","startTime":"05:48","endTime":"05:53","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we've bootstrapped our own everything.","startTime":"05:54","endTime":"05:58","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We build everything straight from source compilers, libraries, tool chains.","startTime":"05:58","endTime":"06:02","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You could kind of think of it as a distro, but an undistro or a distro less distro.","startTime":"06:04","endTime":"06:09","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We have, we don't take the typical distro approach of snapshot the whole world.","startTime":"06:09","endTime":"06:14","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We're much more of a rolling distro rebuild all the time and constantly our product today that we sell and we've got customers, many customers running in production have basically purchased from chain guard hardened container images.","startTime":"06:14","endTime":"06:31","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we build all of this from source so that we can produce a docker image or that'll run in any OCI compliant docker runtime kubernetes and so forth.","startTime":"06:31","endTime":"06:41","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And we keep those docker images@0cve.","startTime":"06:41","endTime":"06:45","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"CVEs are common vulnerabilities and exposures.","startTime":"06:45","endTime":"06:48","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Those are named numbered vulnerabilities.","startTime":"06:49","endTime":"06:52","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And basically we have an SLA with our for our customers that say that we will remediate vulnerabilities criticals within seven days, highs, mediums and lows within 14 days of there being a fix available for that CVE.","startTime":"06:53","endTime":"07:08","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"In doing so we have exceeded the Fedramp standards which are required by the US government in order to remediate CVEs.","startTime":"07:09","endTime":"07:18","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We exceed the FedRAMP mandates which is 30 days for critical, 60 for high, 90 for medium and 120 for low.","startTime":"07:18","endTime":"07:26","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So our customers often when they're buying chainguard, what they're buying is peace of mind that they will get their vulnerabilities remediated well before the Fedramp requirements require.","startTime":"07:26","endTime":"07:37","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And in many cases they've got some work they need to do to rework, rebuild their services, redeploy those services.","startTime":"07:37","endTime":"07:43","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we bought them basically time.","startTime":"07:43","endTime":"07:45","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay, so it's a really well hardened docker image.","startTime":"07:47","endTime":"07:52","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So rolling releases, obviously there must be some friction with old school enterprise when you say rolling releases, because that would probably make a lot of CTOs for legacy firms quite uncomfortable.","startTime":"07:52","endTime":"08:07","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right, so how do you actually think of that?","startTime":"08:07","endTime":"08:09","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, sometimes Victor, but I think for every one of those there's a dozen developers saying yeah, but I want this latest and greatest software, this version of this library that doesn't exist in another distro and won't exist in another distro until the next LTS or major release.","startTime":"08:10","endTime":"08:31","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so there are plenty of developers and platform engineers clamoring for a different way or for something new and different.","startTime":"08:31","endTime":"08:40","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The other thing that we do is enrolling forward.","startTime":"08:40","endTime":"08:46","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We're constantly absorbing all of those security fixes and what we're shipping is exactly vanilla upstream source code built into binaries rather than taking that code and transmuting it with merged patches or ported patches.","startTime":"08:46","endTime":"09:05","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We don't backport patches, that's generally not part of the chainguard strategy.","startTime":"09:05","endTime":"09:10","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we don't snapshot something and then maintain it for 12 or 15 or 10 years or whatever the, you know, the current super long term support is.","startTime":"09:10","endTime":"09:18","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We don't go through that process of having to decide is this patch back portable if we have back ported it, is the software still any good or does it work?","startTime":"09:18","endTime":"09:29","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, in order to backport this is going to take all of this other work that we have to also move forward.","startTime":"09:29","endTime":"09:34","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We just, we don't do that.","startTime":"09:34","endTime":"09:36","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Instead we roll everything forward and in doing so we're shipping a much more, a much closer to the upstream maintainers vision of what they have just released.","startTime":"09:36","endTime":"09:47","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And we often ship that within minutes to hours of upstream releasing.","startTime":"09:47","endTime":"09:51","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And if we can pass, if all of our automation builds, tests, qualifies, signs, we can publish updated images typically within hours of an upstream release that fixes a CVE.","startTime":"09:51","endTime":"10:03","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So those seven and 14 days on the SLA, that's the worst case by far.","startTime":"10:03","endTime":"10:06","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"10:07","endTime":"10:07","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, there's a lot to unpack there because I think the first thing to unpack is if you dive into the world distros in particular, if you look at the amount of patches that applied to any piece of software like you mentioned, backports.","startTime":"10:07","endTime":"10:20","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"10:20","endTime":"10:20","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That's a huge part of the overhead that all the distros more or less will need to maintain.","startTime":"10:20","endTime":"10:27","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"10:27","endTime":"10:27","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And that's.","startTime":"10:27","endTime":"10:28","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you basically say we're not going to do any of that, we're just going to move forward.","startTime":"10:28","endTime":"10:31","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right?","startTime":"10:31","endTime":"10:32","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, very minimally.","startTime":"10:32","endTime":"10:34","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean we have the ability to patch.","startTime":"10:34","endTime":"10:36","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There may be a few dozen patches that by the way we look to drop typically within hours or days of upstream actually releasing that fake.","startTime":"10:36","endTime":"10:45","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So if there is a super critical thing that is in an upstream repository but hasn't been in a cut release yet, we can make a call which says all right, cherry pick that fix.","startTime":"10:45","endTime":"10:57","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We're only backboarding it, you know, a micro version or two.","startTime":"10:57","endTime":"11:01","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We're not backporting it to something that was released in, you know, 20, 15 or something.","startTime":"11:01","endTime":"11:06","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You know, it, this is, it's A it's typically very small and we keep it for a very short duration of time and then drop it as soon as we can and we can get onto a newer released version which again passes upstream testing, passes our cicd, passes all of our integration testing of all these containers have to work together.","startTime":"11:06","endTime":"11:25","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We drop that patch and we don't carry the burden.","startTime":"11:25","endTime":"11:28","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The maintenance of, you know, continuing to need to port that forward.","startTime":"11:28","endTime":"11:31","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"How do you deal with, I mean, backwards compatibility must be coming up quite a lot, right?","startTime":"11:32","endTime":"11:37","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"In particular, I mean what springs to mind is Python 2.7 to Python 3, right?","startTime":"11:37","endTime":"11:41","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Massive breaking changes, right?","startTime":"11:41","endTime":"11:43","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"If you're always rolling on latest, you will have obviously the latest and greatest, but you also will have some cutoff period where there is a breaking change, right?","startTime":"11:44","endTime":"11:55","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And how do you kind of deal with that for your customers?","startTime":"11:55","endTime":"11:57","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because that's.","startTime":"11:57","endTime":"11:57","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That must be painful for some of the customers, right?","startTime":"11:58","endTime":"12:00","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"12:00","endTime":"12:00","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So a couple of things there.","startTime":"12:00","endTime":"12:01","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"First of all, I oversimplified it a little bit with latest and greatest.","startTime":"12:01","endTime":"12:05","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That is true.","startTime":"12:05","endTime":"12:06","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We do that.","startTime":"12:06","endTime":"12:07","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We actually ship all versions and rebuild automatically all versions of any open source software that is still maintained by upstream.","startTime":"12:07","endTime":"12:16","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we only end up life something when the upstream maintainers end of life.","startTime":"12:16","endTime":"12:20","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So if Python still has an LTS or still has a security supported version of 3.13 and 3.12 and 3.10 and if hypothetically there was a 2.7 version, we would continue building all of those.","startTime":"12:20","endTime":"12:35","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And when a customer buys the Python image from us, they get access to all Python images that are simultaneously supported.","startTime":"12:35","endTime":"12:41","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Ditto for Postgres or MySQL or any of the other thousands of open source packages we have.","startTime":"12:41","endTime":"12:50","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Now the second thing is back to compatibility.","startTime":"12:50","endTime":"12:53","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Here's something that's I think really interesting about the modern paradigm, the current paradigm, and that's the container boundary, Victor.","startTime":"12:54","endTime":"13:02","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like within a container you can ship a whole bunch of things that you know, need to work together and that's that application.","startTime":"13:03","endTime":"13:09","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that application still requires and a down level version of, you know, Python, Ruby, Java, some library or something, but you don't have to move all the rest of your infrastructure that might be one of your 2,000 applications that you're maintaining inside of this, you know, giant financial services or health care company.","startTime":"13:09","endTime":"13:28","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And there's an exception made for this one application which sits behind the firewall and it can continue running an older version of Python, but all the rest of the things have access to, you know, newer, later, greater software and then it's really risk management at that point.","startTime":"13:28","endTime":"13:44","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Are you Willing tolerate some number of CVs and unpatched vulnerabilities in this end of life or, you know, less maintained software than the stuff that's truly latest and greatest.","startTime":"13:44","endTime":"13:54","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, because you have, I mean, by moving it to the container level, your blast rate is a lot smaller.","startTime":"13:54","endTime":"13:58","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"13:58","endTime":"13:58","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you don't have to think on.","startTime":"13:58","endTime":"13:59","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.","startTime":"13:59","endTime":"14:01","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Let's talk a bit more about the open source versus the closed source.","startTime":"14:02","endTime":"14:06","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I wouldn't say closed source, but the subscription service.","startTime":"14:06","endTime":"14:09","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"How you want to define that.","startTime":"14:09","endTime":"14:10","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I'm not sure what terminology you guys are using, but how do you kind of split this too?","startTime":"14:10","endTime":"14:15","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right, because obviously you need to make money.","startTime":"14:15","endTime":"14:16","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So obviously providing free disk images is not a great way to just provide revenue streams.","startTime":"14:16","endTime":"14:21","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right, so tell me a bit more like what's your strategy around

byproduct of what we do at Chainguard.","startTime":"21:10","endTime":"21:13","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we produce an SBOM for every single image that we produce.","startTime":"21:13","endTime":"21:18","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Along with that SBOM or within that SBoM, we've got every package, every version of the

and the commit, the exact commit ID where we built this from and the exact tool chain that we used to build that.","startTime":"21:29","endTime":"21:41","speaker_name":"Dustin

software.","startTime":"21:41","endTime":"21:48","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so it's, you know, think about it as a much more machine readable and much more

that's.","startTime":"22:03","endTime":"22:13","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I, I have a few questions around that, right?","startTime":"22:13","endTime":"22:15","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because obviously building SBOMs, people never built SBOMs.","startTime":"22:16","endTime":"22:20","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"They think it's just like, oh, I run a command and here is my sbom.","startTime":"22:20","endTime":"22:23","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Great.","startTime":"22:23","endTime":"22:24","speaker_name":"Viktor

compiler, essentially.","startTime":"22:55","endTime":"22:59","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"How do you guys solve that?","startTime":"22:59","endTime":"23:00","speaker_name":"Viktor Petersson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, it's sort of a sum of different, a couple of different pieces.","startTime":"23:01","endTime":"23:04","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You know, we've got, at our core we've got a build system that is driven by GitHub Actions and then runs build jobs in Google Cloud.","startTime":"23:04","endTime":"23:17","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Basically we start with building packages.","startTime":"23:17","endTime":"23:20","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Our package format is apk, which is the Alpine package format.","startTime":"23:20","endTime":"23:24","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We're not a derivative of Alpine, but we use the APK package

apk.","startTime":"23:30","endTime":"23:32","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Out of that comes the files that get laid down on the file system, plus a little bit of metadata.","startTime":"23:32","endTime":"23:37","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The, the, basically the S BOM and A dot

at that moment in time.","startTime":"23:43","endTime":"23:50","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And we've actually got a patch set in a PR in flight right now where we're adding in the case where we carry any patches, you know, I told you earlier, we don't carry patches very often.","startTime":"23:50","endTime":"24:01","speaker_name":"Dustin

internally to define the images.","startTime":"24:26","endTime":"24:30","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Images for us are those container images.","startTime":"24:30","endTime":"24:33","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The images then are built from a set of packages that get installed, plus some other things

Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So instead we do that at the image layer.","startTime":"25:18","endTime":"25:21","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that image will include, add the Postfix user, set its uid, create its home directory, run whatever scripts we need to do to configure.","startTime":"25:21","endTime":"25:29","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Configure Postfix.","startTime":"25:29","endTime":"25:31","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then some of that allows for Docker style, environment variables and injection of metadata and data that happens at that image level.","startTime":"25:31","endTime":"25:44","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The image itself comes with its master SBOM of everything that's in that image, which is sort of the packages have their sboms of what's in the package and then the image is.","startTime":"25:44","endTime":"25:56","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Includes an sbom of all the packages that are in there as well.","startTime":"25:56","endTime":"26:00","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you have a hierarchy of pointers essentially inside the

thing.","startTime":"26:06","endTime":"26:20","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So, you know, the goal is totally reproducible, whether it's us, we need to rebuild it

with.","startTime":"32:49","endTime":"32:51","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We typically pull.","startTime":"32:52","endTime":"32:54","speaker_name":"Dustin

fix, and then republished that.","startTime":"33:47","endTime":"33:53","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But the other thing we did is we took a full audit of our source

could.","startTime":"33:53","endTime":"34:10","speaker_name":"Dustin Kirkland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What we do now instead is when we build a package, we use git ostensibly, if not git, then
