    I'm joined by Sean Martin, co-founder of ITSPmagazine and veteran security expert, to explore the evolving landscape of software supply chain security. Recorded live at Hacker Summer Camp, we dive into how transparency is replacing vague security claims and why SBOMs are becoming real-time operational assets.

Sean Martin's journey into software security spans over three decades, but his latest focus, software supply chain security, feels more relevant than ever. As co-founder of ITSPmagazine and a veteran of countless product launches at Symantec, Sean brings a rare operational lens to security.

In this crossover episode of Nerding out with Viktor, recorded live at Hacker Summer Camp, Sean joins me to unpack what's changing in the security landscape, from SBOM adoption to the increasing pressure from regulations like the CRA. We explore how supply chain security is becoming table stakes, how transparency is replacing vague claims ("saying you're secure means absolutely nothing"), and why SBOMs are evolving into real-time operational assets rather than static compliance artifacts.

The conversation dives deep into practical workflows, from integrating SBOMs in CI/CD to refactoring legacy systems and building AI-powered developer agents. We discuss why automation and guardrails are critical when working with LLMs, and how engineers may soon supervise fleets of purpose-built agents instead of writing every line of code themselves.

From fish tank hacks to IoT compliance theatre, the episode is full of examples where security promises break down without real architecture behind them. Sean's three decades of experience shine through as he connects historical patterns to current challenges, showing how the fundamentals of good security architecture remain constant even as the tools and threats evolve.
