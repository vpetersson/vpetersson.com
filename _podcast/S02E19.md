    Nick Selby, a veteran security leader known for his clear-eyed approach to building practical, human-centered security programs, joins Viktor to tackle a central question that haunts many growing tech companies: why do so many teams treat software security compliance as a box-ticking exercise, and what does that mindset cost them? Drawing from decades of experience, Nick brings both humor and hard-won lessons to an issue that often feels more bureaucratic than technical.

Why do so many teams treat software security compliance as a box-ticking exercise, and what does that mindset cost them? In this episode of Nerding Out with Viktor, I sit down with Nick Selby, a veteran security leader known for his clear-eyed approach to building practical, human-centered security programs.

Nick traces his path from the early days of hands-on security work, where risk was measured by intuition and experience, to the era of standardized frameworks and regulatory oversight. He reflects on how compliance frameworks like SOC 2 and ISO 27001 emerged to bring order to chaos but often became ends in themselves. Instead of driving real-world resilience, they sometimes created a false sense of assurance. For Nick, this isn't just a process problem; it's a cultural one. He argues that companies should see compliance as the outcome of good security practices, not the starting point.

As the conversation deepens, we explore the messy middle between technical rigor and operational reality. We discuss the rise of AI tools in engineering workflows and how adoption often outpaces security readiness. Nick shares examples of companies racing to integrate generative AI without understanding the privacy and threat implications. We dig into the cultural dynamics that cause even well-intentioned teams to make risky shortcuts, especially when compliance audits and investor expectations start to shape technical decisions more than engineering principles.

The discussion also turns toward the evolution of modern frameworks and legislation, from the Cyber Resilience Act to the growing importance of SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials) in software supply chains. Nick explains how these measures can bring much-needed transparency to vendor accountability but warns against treating them as magic bullets. Compliance, he suggests, should evolve alongside the products themselves, adapting as systems grow, architectures shift, and user expectations change.

By the end of the episode, the message is clear: software security compliance should serve the business, not the other way around. Nick and I leave listeners with a challenge to rethink how they build trust and resilience into their systems, not just their documentation. For anyone passionate about open source, product development, or building technology that lasts, this is a conversation worth tuning into.
