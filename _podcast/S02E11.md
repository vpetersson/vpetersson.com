    Managing remote teams isn't just about Slack pings and Zoom calls, it's about building systems that let people move fast without losing clarity. In this episode of Nerding Out With Viktor, host Viktor Petersson welcomes back Jon Seager, VP of Engineering at Canonical, for a candid conversation on managing remote teams.
    They explore how Canonical structures its fully distributed engineering org and the systems that help remote teams deliver real output. With Jon's experience scaling remote teams at Canonical and Viktor's decade-and-a-half leading distributed organizations, this is a grounded, practical look at the workflows and mindsets shaping modern remote leadership.
    Topics covered:
    How to measure output (not activity) in remote teams
    Calendar ownership and why it's a predictor of performance
    Structuring one-on-ones and retros that actually matter
    Setting up ergonomic home offices and boundaries
    Documentation debt, tribal knowledge, and onboarding traps
    Building trust and autonomy without micromanagement
    What new remote managers consistently get wrong

    A must-watch for engineering leaders, remote managers, and anyone figuring out how to scale without an office.

In this episode, I'm joined by Jon Seager, VP of Engineering at Canonical, for a deep dive into the systems and practices that make remote teams thrive. Jon's experience scaling Canonical's distributed engineering organization offers unique insights into what really works in remote leadership.

We start by exploring how Canonical structures its fully distributed engineering organization. What particularly caught my attention was Jon's approach to measuring output rather than activity, and how this fundamental shift in perspective drives better results. His explanation of calendar ownership as a performance predictor reveals the subtle but crucial aspects of remote work culture.

The conversation gets especially interesting when we dive into the practical aspects of remote team management. Jon shares valuable insights about structuring effective one-on-ones and retrospectives, emphasizing the importance of clear communication and documentation. His perspective on setting up ergonomic home offices and maintaining healthy boundaries shows how physical workspace impacts remote productivity.

I was particularly intrigued by our discussion of documentation and knowledge sharing. Jon's approach to combating documentation debt and tribal knowledge reveals how Canonical maintains clarity across its distributed teams. We also explore the delicate balance between trust and accountability, with Jon offering practical strategies for building autonomy without micromanagement.

If you're leading remote teams or scaling distributed organizations, you'll find plenty of practical insights here. Jon brings both deep experience and thoughtful analysis to the discussion, making complex remote management concepts accessible while maintaining their practical depth.
