Today I'm joined by Philipp Deppenwiese from Binarly for a deep technical dive into firmware security. If you've been following the security space, you might know Binarly for their impressive work uncovering BIOS vulnerabilities like PixieFail and LogoFail.

We start by exploring attestation - a crucial yet often overlooked aspect of secure computing. Philipp breaks down how it differs from traditional secure boot mechanisms, particularly when it comes to verifying what code is actually running on a system. What I found particularly interesting was his explanation of how TPMs can facilitate attestation, creating an unbreakable chain of trust from boot to runtime.

The conversation gets really interesting when we discuss the practical challenges of implementing secure boot in different environments. Philipp shares his insights on why it can be particularly tricky in Linux compared to Windows, and we explore the entire boot flow from firmware to kernel. His explanation of how certain technologies enable secure computation on cloud stacks was eye-opening.

One of the most valuable parts of our discussion focuses on transparency in modern computing. Philipp points out how many of us "just run things" without questioning the underlying software or firmware, and we discuss why this can be dangerous. We also get into Binarly's innovative solutions using TPMs and attestation, which I think shows a promising direction for the future of system security.

If you're interested in firmware security, TPMs, or how modern systems establish trust from the ground up, you'll find plenty of practical insights here. Philipp brings deep technical knowledge but explains complex concepts in a way that makes them accessible without losing the technical depth.
