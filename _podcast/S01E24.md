In this episode, I'm joined by Ken Munro for an eye-opening discussion about security vulnerabilities in transportation and IoT systems. Ken's work in penetration testing has revealed some seriously concerning issues in systems we rely on daily, and I was eager to dig into the details.

We start by exploring GPS systems - not just the US Global Positioning System that most people know, but the whole family of satellite-based navigation systems. Ken walks me through some shocking vulnerabilities he's discovered, particularly in maritime systems. What really caught my attention was his demonstration of how relatively easy it is to compromise these critical systems.

The conversation takes a fascinating turn when we discuss IoT security. Ken shares some incredible stories from his penetration testing work, showing how seemingly innocent devices can become serious security risks. We explore real examples of vulnerabilities he's found, and what makes these systems so challenging to secure properly.

I particularly enjoyed our discussion about the broader implications of these security issues. We dive into how these vulnerabilities could affect global trade and security, and what needs to change in the industry. Ken brings up some thought-provoking points about the balance between innovation and security, especially in transportation systems.

If you're interested in cybersecurity, IoT, or transportation systems, you'll find plenty of technical insights here. Ken has a unique way of explaining complex security concepts through real-world examples, making the implications clear without getting lost in technical jargon.
