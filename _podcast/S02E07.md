In this deep-dive conversation, Viktor sits down with Vlad Ionescu, founder and CEO of [Earthly](https://earthly.dev), to unpack the evolution of CI/CD, why developer experience is broken, and what it will take to bring sanity back to software delivery at scale.

From Google's internal build systems to the chaotic sprawl of modern pipelines, Vlad draws on his background at FAANG and Earthly to highlight why most teams are stuck with fragmented tooling, unpredictable environments, and compliance bottlenecks that only get worse with scale.

We get into the core challenges of today's SDLC:
- CI that is invisible but critical and riddled with governance gaps
- Why "run it locally" is still a dream for most teams
- The trust and tooling mismatch between platform and security teams and app developers
- The hidden risk of blindly using plugins and actions without audit trails

Vlad shares how Earthly's new product, Lunar, aims to bridge these gaps by bringing monitoring and policy enforcement to the pre-prod lifecycle, much like observability did for production.

We also dig into:
- The tension between agility and standardization in microservices
- How remote and hybrid work affect engineering culture and accountability
- Why most companies do not suffer from lack of rules but from lack of clarity and enforcement

The conversation rounds out with a sharp look at AI in the software lifecycle. What happens when LLMs generate entire products, and what are the risks of skipping over code comprehension in favor of velocity? Vlad's take: without guardrails, we are heading toward a future of tech debt at hyperspeed.

Whether you are in DevOps, platform engineering, or just tired of pushing CI fixes at 2 a.m., this is a real-world conversation on building smarter, safer, and more scalable developer workflows.
