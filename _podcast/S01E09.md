In this episode of "Nerding Out with Viktor," Iâ€™m joined by Chris Swan, a veteran of the London tech scene. Chris and I recently reconnected at State of OpenCon in London, where he presented on OpenSSF Scorecards. Intrigued by the topic, I invited him to the show to delve deeper into the concept.

Chris introduces himself and shares his background as an engineer at AtSign, a company developing a networking 2.0 platform focused on end-to-end encrypted connections. He explains how his role in security-critical functionalities at AtSign led him to OpenSSF and Scorecards. Chris also provides a brief history of his career, starting from his time in the Royal Navy as a combat systems engineer, moving through the dot-com bubble, financial services, and various roles in IT services and startups.

I ask Chris to elaborate on OpenSSF, the Open Source Security Foundation, which is relatively new and part of the Linux Foundation. Chris explains that OpenSSF, driven initially by Google, aims to improve security across the open-source ecosystem. He highlights how the Scorecard project within OpenSSF allows organizations to demonstrate their commitment to security.

Chris shares how AtSign adopted Scorecards to show their dedication to security, especially for their open-source repositories. He notes that Scorecards provide a visual indicator of security practices, which has been effective in addressing potential customers' security concerns.

Curious about the applicability of Scorecards to private repositories, I ask Chris for his thoughts. He affirms that while the Scorecards are particularly beneficial for public repositories, they can also drive good security practices internally within organizations, even for private repositories.

Chris then dives into the specifics of Scorecards, explaining the various metrics they evaluate, such as dependency management, CI/CD practices, static and dynamic analysis, and compliance with OpenSSF best practices. He describes how Scorecards parse GitHub workflows and other indicators to assess these metrics, encouraging a culture of security within the development process.

We discuss the impact of Scorecards on development practices, emphasizing the cultural shift towards better security hygiene. We also touch on the challenges of maintaining quick feedback cycles in CI/CD pipelines while integrating comprehensive security checks.

The conversation then shifts to SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials), with Chris explaining their importance in providing transparency about software dependencies and potential vulnerabilities. He outlines the genesis of SBOMs, driven by a US executive order, and their role in supply chain security. We discuss the challenges and current state of SBOM tooling and its integration into CI/CD workflows.

Chris provides a brief overview of NIST 2.0, the updated cybersecurity framework recently released, noting its emphasis on governance and the inclusion of newer security paradigms. He emphasizes the evolving landscape of cybersecurity standards and their implications for organizations.

As we wrap up the episode, Chris highlights AtSign's open-source product, SSH NoPorts, which allows for remote administration without open ports. He encourages listeners to explore this tool, especially those dealing with IoT devices and home labs.

I thank Chris for the insightful discussion, and we conclude the episode with an invitation to listeners to check out AtSign and SSH NoPorts for more information.
