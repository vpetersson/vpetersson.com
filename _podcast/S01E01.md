In the inaugural episode of "Nerding Out With Viktor," I dive into the intricate world of Cloud Native security with my guest, Andy Martin from ControlPlane. As a seasoned security engineer, Andy brings a wealth of experience in servicing regulated industries like finance and government, offering unique insights into the field.

We cover a variety of engaging topics in this episode. We start by introducing Andy and ControlPlane, where Andy shares his journey in security engineering and the evolution of ControlPlane. The conversation then shifts to a review of the memorable "Internet of Shit" conference talk, a presentation that Andy and I gave together, highlighting key insights and takeaways.

Penetration Testing is another critical topic we explore, where we break down its concept and discuss its role in assessing both digital and physical security systems. We also navigate through the complexities of Social Engineering Attacks, discussing various forms including phishing and more sophisticated strategies.

Our discussion takes a deeper dive into the ethics of hacking, examining the differences between Black Hat, White Hat, and Grey Hat hackers and their impact on cybersecurity. We also tackle the debate of On-Prem vs. Cloud Security, offering a critical analysis of the security aspects of both on-premise and cloud-based solutions.

We further examine the relevance and limitations of Compliance and Certifications in Cybersecurity, focusing specifically on certifications like SOC 2 and ISO 27001. The episode also introduces the Zero Trust Security Model, where we discuss its importance and how it can be implemented in modern cybersecurity practices.

A highlight of the episode is when Andy conducts a practical Threat Modeling Exercise, showcasing real-time risk assessment strategies. Finally, we discuss Supply Chain Security and Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs), diving into their challenges and importance in software development.

This episode is a treasure trove of information for cybersecurity professionals, IT enthusiasts, and anyone interested in the latest trends and practices in digital security. Donâ€™t forget to subscribe, like, and share for more insightful discussions on "Nerding Out With Viktor."
