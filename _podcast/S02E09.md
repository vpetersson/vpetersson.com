In this deep-dive conversation, I sit down with Joshua Watt (Garmin) and Ross Burton (ARM) to explore how the Yocto Project is redefining how we build, secure, and maintain embedded Linux systems at scale.

Drawing on their years of experience contributing to Yocto's technical steering and core infrastructure, Joshua and Ross walk through why build-time Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) offer unmatched reliability, how SPDX 3.0 enables deeper license and supply chain visibility, and what it really takes to keep embedded products secure across decade-long lifecycles.

We get into the practical and architectural challenges behind modern embedded development:

- Why shipping Raspberry Pi OS at scale is a ticking time bomb (and what to do instead)
- What Yocto actually is, and why it's not just another Linux distribution
- How build-time SBOMs outperform post-hoc scanners for audit and incident response
- What VEX metadata is, and how it improves real-world vulnerability triage
- How SPDX 3.0 enables granular license tracking and nested component relationships
- Why OTA updates should be a design-time decision, not an afterthought

Joshua also shares what it took to build Yocto's native SBOM tooling (`create-spdx`), and how the project is adapting to new pressures from regulation, such as the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), and increasingly security-aware supply chains.

We also cover:

- Managing SBOMs across multi-layer BSP stacks and opaque vendor binaries
- Using BitBake's hashserver to enforce reproducible, compliant builds
- The philosophical shift SBOMs are triggering in the embedded world
- What's next for SPDX, Yocto security tooling, and vulnerability automation

The episode wraps with advice for embedded developers trying to get started with SBOMs in Yocto, from common misconceptions to integration tips and where to plug into the community.

Whether you're a firmware engineer, security lead, or building connected products that need to survive for 10+ years, this episode is packed with battle-tested insight from engineers shaping the tools behind secure embedded Linux.
