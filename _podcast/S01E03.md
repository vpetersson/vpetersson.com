In this episode, I'm joined by Jon Seager, VP of Enterprise Engineering at Canonical, to explore the fascinating world of Nix. Jon's experience with automation tools like JuJu and charms offers unique insights into how Nix is transforming software development and system management.

We start with the dual nature of Nix as both a functional programming language and a package manager. What particularly caught my attention was Nix's ability to create truly reproducible systems - a feature that sets it apart in the software development landscape. Jon's explanation of how NixOS combines the Nix package manager with its module system reveals the elegant simplicity of immutable system configuration.

The conversation gets especially interesting when Jon shares his home setup. His integration of NixOS with TailScale for a zero-trust environment demonstrates the practical power of Nix's declarative approach. The way he maintains his system configuration shows how Nix can make complex setups both secure and manageable.

I was particularly intrigued by the resources Jon has curated for the Nix community. For those wanting to dive deeper into the Nix ecosystem, here are some invaluable resources:

* [Zero to Nix](https://zero-to-nix.com/) - The perfect starting point
* [Determinate Systems' Nix Installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer) - Streamlined Nix setup
* [Jon's NixOS Config](https://github.com/jnsgruk/nixos-config) - Real-world configuration example
* [Wil T's Nix Guides](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Wil_T_Nix_Guides) - Comprehensive learning resources
* [Jon's Libations](https://github.com/jnsgruk/libations) - Creative Nix applications

If you're interested in system configuration, reproducible builds, or the future of package management, you'll find plenty of practical insights here. Jon brings both deep technical knowledge and hands-on experience to the discussion, making complex Nix concepts accessible while maintaining their technical depth.
