In this episode of "Nerding Out with Viktor," I’m joined by Eben Upton, the founder of the Raspberry Pi Foundation, to discuss the origins, evolution, and future of Raspberry Pi. We start by diving into Eben's background as a software engineer and his early interest in home computers during the 1980s. This passion for computing led him to establish the Raspberry Pi Foundation with the goal of reigniting interest in computer science among young people.

Eben shares how, in the 1990s, there was a noticeable decline in the number of students applying to study computer science at Cambridge University. This decline motivated him and his colleagues to create an affordable, programmable home computer to inspire a new generation of programmers. When the Raspberry Pi launched in 2012, it was an immediate success, selling 100,000 units on its first day. Initially embraced by enthusiasts, the Raspberry Pi quickly found its way into educational and industrial applications.

We discuss the widespread adoption of the Raspberry Pi across various sectors. Eben highlights how, while the platform was initially targeted at education, it has become a valuable tool for industrial applications as well. He mentions companies like Screenly, which have utilized Raspberry Pi for digital signage, showing how the device has helped reduce costs and improve efficiency for many businesses.

Our conversation then shifts to the challenges faced during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly the supply chain crisis that affected the availability of semiconductors. Eben describes the tough decisions the Raspberry Pi Foundation had to make, such as prioritizing OEM customers to keep businesses running. Despite these challenges, they managed to maintain a steady supply of Raspberry Pi units and even continued their engineering efforts, leading to the release of Raspberry Pi 5.

Eben explains that manufacturing Raspberry Pi in the UK has been a strategic decision. Local manufacturing offers significant benefits, such as better communication with the factory and the ability to quickly implement design changes. While most components are sourced globally, the final assembly and some parts, like the injection-molded plastics, are produced in the UK.

Looking to the future, we discuss the potential for Raspberry Pi to adopt RISC-V, an open-source hardware instruction set architecture. Eben outlines the advantages and challenges of moving to RISC-V, including the significant engineering effort required to develop a high-performance, open-source core. While acknowledging the potential benefits, he indicates that Raspberry Pi 6 will likely continue to use ARM cores due to their maturity and ecosystem support.

We also cover the evolution of the Raspberry Pi software stack. Eben talks about the shift towards open standards, such as adopting VDPAU for Linux and moving towards a Wayland-based graphics interface. These changes aim to improve performance and compatibility, particularly for applications involving multimedia and digital signage.

Eben and I then delve into the reliability issues with SD cards, a common pain point for Raspberry Pi users. Eben explains that while there are many subpar SD cards on the market, high-quality cards like those from SanDisk have proven reliable under rigorous testing. We also discuss the potential for future Raspberry Pi models to include soldered-down eMMC storage, providing a more robust alternative to SD cards.

We wrap up the episode with a discussion on the importance of mentoring and supporting young people interested in technology. Eben shares a personal story about how mentors played a crucial role in his early development as a programmer. I couldn’t agree more, and I emphasize that mentoring has been vital in my own career.

Overall, this episode offers a comprehensive look at the past, present, and future of Raspberry Pi, highlighting its impact on education, industry, and the broader tech community.
