In this episode, I'm joined by Eben Upton, the founder of Raspberry Pi Foundation, for a fascinating discussion about affordable computing and its impact on education and industry. Eben's journey from observing declining computer science applications at Cambridge to creating a global computing phenomenon offers unique insights into how simple ideas can transform technology education.

We start with Eben's early computing experiences in the 1980s, which shaped his vision for Raspberry Pi. What particularly struck me was the story of the Pi's launch in 2012, selling an incredible 100,000 units on day one. This success story takes an interesting turn as we explore how Pi expanded beyond education into industrial applications, including my own experience with Screenly using Pi for digital signage.

The conversation gets especially interesting when we dive into the challenges faced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Eben shares candid insights about the tough decisions made to prioritize OEM customers and maintain supply chains. His explanation of why they manufacture in the UK, balancing global sourcing with local assembly, reveals the practical complexities of hardware production.

I was particularly intrigued by our discussion about future technologies. We explore the potential of RISC-V architecture, with Eben offering a pragmatic view of its adoption challenges. The reliability issues with SD cards - a topic I'm deeply familiar with from my work with Screenly - led to an enlightening discussion about storage solutions and the possibility of soldered-down eMMC storage in future models.

If you're interested in hardware innovation, education technology, or the challenges of scaling a hardware platform, you'll find plenty of practical insights here. Eben brings both technical depth and strategic vision to the discussion, offering a unique perspective on how affordable computing can transform both education and industry.
