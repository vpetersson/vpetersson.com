In this timely conversation with Johan Christenson, founder of [Cleura](https://cleura.com) and board member of OpenInfra (overseeing Kata Containers and OpenStack), we dive into Europe's growing urgency around digital sovereignty and what it will actually take to build a competitive, homegrown cloud ecosystem. Johan, a long-time advocate for open source infrastructure, pulls back the curtain on why progress has been so slow and where things can shift.

We kick off by looking at Europe's deep dependence on U.S. cloud providers, and the real-world risks that come with it. From pricing power and data availability to political influence and tech autonomy, Johan explains how this imbalance affects everything from government policy to startup growth.

A major part of our conversation breaks down the key blockers that have kept Europe stuck:

- Procurement systems that favor incumbents over local innovation
- Long-standing vendor lock-in across schools, agencies, and enterprises
- A steady brain drain of top talent to non-European tech companies
- Innovation programs that reward optics over sustainable outcomes
- The sheer complexity of building a scalable, fully independent cloud stack

Johan explains the uphill battle smaller providers face when going up against hyperscalers — not just on price, but on the range and depth of services they offer. He draws a sharp contrast between basic infrastructure and the fully integrated ecosystems that dominate the market.

We explore his experience building on OpenStack, including:

- Why his company committed early to open infrastructure
- Lessons from over a decade of contributing to and operating at scale
- How complexity, resilience, and governance affect platform choices
- Why internal capability-building matters more than plug-and-play simplicity

From there, we expand into bigger-picture ideas: how European vendors could collaborate more effectively, the role of technical standards in shaping markets, and how cloud-native tools like Kubernetes, if used thoughtfully, might help smaller players compete.

The episode wraps with a sharp take on Europe's regulatory landscape. Johan argues that the problem isn't a lack of rules, but the lack of enforcement. He walks through how the disconnect between policy ambitions and operational reality slows down even the most well-intentioned builders.

If you're thinking seriously about digital independence, infrastructure sovereignty, or Europe's place in the global tech stack, this conversation is both a clear-eyed reality check and a grounded look at where change could come from.
