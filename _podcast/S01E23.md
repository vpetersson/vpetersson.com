Today I'm joined by Massi Gori for a deep dive into modern authentication systems. Having worked extensively with these technologies, I was particularly excited to get Massi's insights on where we're heading with authentication and access control.

We start by exploring the evolution from traditional passwords to passkeys. Massi breaks down the technical aspects of FIDO2, but what I found most valuable was his practical experience implementing these systems in enterprise environments. We discuss the real challenges organizations face when transitioning to modern authentication methods, and how to overcome them.

The conversation gets particularly interesting when we dive into OpenSSH certificates and Vault. Massi shares some fascinating insights about how these tools can work together to create robust authentication systems. What really caught my attention was his approach to balancing security with usability - something that's often overlooked in authentication discussions.

I especially enjoyed our discussion about the future of authentication. We explore how passkeys are changing the game for both users and organizations, and what this means for traditional password-based systems. Massi brings up some thought-provoking points about the challenges of managing authentication at scale, and we discuss practical solutions that work in the real world.

If you're dealing with authentication systems, whether in a small team or a large enterprise, you'll find plenty of actionable insights here. Massi does a great job of explaining complex security concepts while keeping the focus on practical, implementable solutions.
