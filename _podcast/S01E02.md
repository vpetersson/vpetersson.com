In this episode of "Nerding Out With Viktor," I have an in-depth conversation with Julius Volz, the co-founder of Prometheus and founder of PromLab. We delve into the origins and development of Prometheus, an open-source monitoring system that has become the gold standard for metrics-based systems monitoring. Julius shares his journey, starting from his time at Google, where he worked with Borgmon, to co-creating Prometheus as a solution to the limitations of existing open-source monitoring systems.

Julius breaks down the technical aspects of Prometheus, including its dimensional data model, its powerful query language (PromQL), and how it efficiently handles time series data. He also addresses some common pitfalls that new users often encounter, particularly around metric design and the issue of "cardinality bombs." We then explore best practices in server monitoring, the critical role of Prometheus' alert manager, and the challenges of long-term data storage, highlighting tools like Cortex and Thanos as solutions.

We also discuss the simplicity and flexibility of writing Prometheus exporters, even for those with minimal coding experience. Julius shares some unique and interesting use cases for Prometheus, such as monitoring wind power parks, shipping vessels, and even the German train system. He provides a live demonstration of PromQL, explaining functions like `rate`, `irate`, and `increase`, and their practical applications in real-world scenarios.

Our conversation then turns to future trends in observability, where we touch upon the role of eBPF in Prometheus, the integration with OpenTelemetry, and the ongoing evolution of the OpenMetrics project. Julius also talks about his current focus on providing Prometheus training through PromLabs, where he offers both live and self-paced courses.

This episode is packed with technical insights, practical advice, and a comprehensive overview of Prometheus's pivotal role in the evolving landscape of systems monitoring and observability.
