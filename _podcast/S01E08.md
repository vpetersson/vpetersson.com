In this episode, I'm joined by Simon Westh Henriksen, co-founder of [Kin](https://mykin.ai/) (formerly Hyphen), to explore the fascinating intersection of AI and privacy. Simon's journey from software engineer to Web3 innovator offers unique insights into how we can build AI systems that respect user privacy while remaining highly functional.

We start with Simon's path to founding Kin, which took an interesting turn during the COVID-19 pandemic when he dove deep into Web3. What particularly caught my attention was his vision for a privacy-first personal AI assistant. Simon's explanation of how they handle data locally on devices while maintaining AI functionality reveals the practical challenges of balancing convenience with security.

The conversation gets especially interesting when we explore the future of AI interaction. Simon shares his thoughts on AI agents communicating with each other and the potential of decentralized web nodes for data portability. His insights into managing AI hallucinations and the ethical considerations in AI development highlight the complexities of building responsible AI systems.

I was particularly intrigued by our discussion of data sovereignty in an AI-centric world. Simon's approach to giving users control over their digital data while still enabling powerful AI capabilities shows how privacy and functionality don't have to be mutually exclusive. We also explore Kin's beta program and their vision for the future of personal AI assistants.

If you're interested in AI, privacy, Web3, or the future of personal computing, you'll find plenty of practical insights here. Simon brings both technical depth and entrepreneurial experience to the discussion, making complex concepts around AI and privacy accessible while maintaining their technical sophistication.
