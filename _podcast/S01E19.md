In this captivating conversation, Viktor sits down with Justin to explore the evolution of Docker, the challenges and triumphs of containerization, and the exciting potential of Wasm. As a key figure in Docker's history, Justin shares his unique perspective on the company's journey, its impact on the DevOps community, and how Docker continues to innovate in an ever-changing tech landscape.

The conversation begins with Justin's first encounter with Docker, which sets the stage for his long and ongoing relationship with the company. Viktor and Justin then delve into the often-debated topic of containers vs. virtual machines (VMs), where Justin explains why this framing is misleading and how Docker's real success lies in simplifying application packaging, deployment, and management.

As they navigate through the early days of Docker, Justin recounts the challenges the company faced in a small market with significant competition. Despite these hurdles, Docker emerged as a disruptive force, particularly among early cloud adopters who recognized the potential benefits of containers. Viktor and Justin also discuss Docker's decision to start charging for Docker Desktop, which sparked controversy within the tech community.

The conversation then shifts to Docker Hub, its infrastructure, and the challenges of managing a global service at scale. Justin offers an inside look at how Docker has adapted to meet growing demands, from the early days when outages made headlines to the present where Docker Hub has become an indispensable resource for millions of developers.

Justin also takes Viktor on a journey through the evolution of Docker image security, explaining how early images had cryptographic signatures but no real content hashes, making them vulnerable. He discusses how Docker transitioned to the V2 format, introducing proper content hashing and significantly improving image security.

One of Docker's latest innovations, Docker Scout, is another topic of discussion. Justin explains how this tool generates Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) and tracks vulnerabilities in real-time, allowing developers to stay on top of security issues without needing constant re-scanning. Viktor and Justin explore the potential of WebAssembly (Wasm), discussing its possibilities in both server-side and browser-based applications.

As they conclude their conversation, Justin shares his thoughts on the future of Docker and cloud-native development. He emphasizes Docker's focus on empowering developers and providing seamless tooling for containerized environments, which remains at the core of its mission.

**Why listen to this episode?** If you're a developer, DevOps enthusiast, or tech leader interested in the evolution of containerization and Wasm, this conversation is packed with valuable insights. From Docker's early days of rapid growth and market challenges to its present role as a leader in cloud-native development, Justin Cormack's unique perspective offers listeners a front-row seat to the pivotal moments that shaped Docker and its impact on the tech world.
