In this episode, I'm joined by Daniel Stenberg, the creator of Curl, for a fascinating journey through open-source development. Daniel's path from the Commodore 64 demo scene to building one of the most widely-used tools in software development offers unique insights into both technical evolution and community building.

We begin with Daniel's early days programming on the C64 and Amiga, where he cut his teeth in the demo scene. What really caught my attention was how these experiences shaped his approach to programming and eventually led to Curl's development at IBM. His journey from hobby coder to maintaining critical internet infrastructure is both inspiring and instructive.

The conversation takes an entertaining turn when Daniel shares some of the most unusual support requests he's received. These stories not only highlight Curl's ubiquity but also reveal common misconceptions about open-source software. I particularly enjoyed his practical insights into managing a project that millions of developers rely on daily.

We dive deep into Curl's technical evolution, discussing how Daniel approaches backward compatibility and protocol support. His explanation of the careful balance between adding new features and maintaining stability shows the real challenges of maintaining widely-used infrastructure. The discussion about preventing supply chain attacks and ensuring code integrity was especially relevant given today's security landscape.

If you're interested in open-source development, maintaining critical infrastructure, or building developer communities, you'll find plenty of practical insights here. Daniel brings decades of experience maintaining one of the internet's most crucial tools, sharing both technical wisdom and practical lessons about sustainable open-source development.
