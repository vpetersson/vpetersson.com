Marcus Taylor's journey into technology spans over three decades, but his latest work at Planet Computers represents a fascinating convergence of everything he's learned about hardware, networks, and resilient systems. As co-founder of Planet Computers, Marcus brings a rare operational lens to building niche devices that serve specific communities.

Marcus' story begins with IBM labs and Logica, where he explored natural language processing and early mobile wallet prototypes in the mid-90s. Those experiments laid the groundwork for later projects at Ericsson, Digital Mobility, and the GSM Association, where he navigated the politics of telco standards and helped bring Bluetooth and Wi-Fi into the mainstream.

The conversation then turns to Erlang, the programming language behind WhatsApp and critical banking systems. Taylor recounts how his consultancy supported Ericsson, financial institutions, and global telecom providers in building fault-tolerant infrastructure that could handle real-world demands - from base stations to payment clearing systems.

From there, we dive into Planet Computers - the company reviving the keyboard-first form factor through devices like the Gemini, Cosmo, and Astro. These Planet Computers smartphones are niche by design, serving journalists, security teams, and technologists who need multi-boot Android/Linux flexibility and secure communications. Marcus explains the challenges of building hardware for specialized markets and the economics of competing with giants like Samsung and Apple.

The episode explores how Planet Computers has evolved beyond smartphones into network appliances for Industry 4.0 applications. Marcus details their work with AI-powered CNC machine monitoring in Singapore, using edge computing to give machinists real-time feedback on tool wear and machine performance. We also discuss their logistics tracking system using mesh networks for Brexit-related customs automation.

Taylor closes with reflections on the future of telcos, private 5G networks, and preventive health technology through his work with Invisa smart shoes. For builders, engineers, and founders, this is a rare perspective on how niche devices and resilient networks still shape the backbone of modern systems, and why specialized hardware continues to find its place in an increasingly software-defined world.
