In this episode, I'm joined by Guillaume Bélanger from Canonical to explore the fascinating world of telecom innovation. Guillaume's extensive experience in the sector offers unique insights into how open source is revolutionizing the industry.

We start by diving into groundbreaking projects like Magma and SD-Core that are reshaping private network management. What particularly caught my attention was Guillaume's explanation of how these initiatives are transforming traditional network infrastructure. His breakdown of e-SIM technology and its potential to revolutionize device connectivity reveals just how much the landscape is changing.

The conversation gets especially interesting when we explore the technical aspects of 5G. Guillaume walks through the intricacies of core and radio networks, software-defined networking, and the practical challenges of setting up private 5G networks. His insights into the hardware requirements and regulatory considerations provide a comprehensive view of what it takes to deploy these systems.

I was particularly intrigued by our discussion about tech giants like Google and Amazon entering the telecom space. Guillaume's perspective on how these companies are influencing the industry, combined with Canonical's open source approach, highlights the evolving dynamics of modern telecommunications.

If you're interested in network infrastructure, telecom innovation, or the future of connectivity, you'll find plenty of practical insights here. Guillaume brings both deep technical knowledge and industry experience to the discussion, making complex telecom concepts accessible while maintaining their technical depth.
