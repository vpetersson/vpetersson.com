    I'm joined by Carl Richell, founder and CEO of System76, for an in-depth look at what it takes to build an open source hardware company from the ground up. Carl's journey, from launching Ubuntu laptops before Linux was mainstream to building open firmware, a desktop environment, and even their own factory, is one of the most hands-on stories in open source computing.

In this episode, I'm joined by Carl Richell, founder and CEO of System76, for an in-depth look at what it takes to build an open source hardware company from the ground up. Carl's journey, from launching Ubuntu laptops before Linux was mainstream to building open firmware, a desktop environment, and even their own factory, is one of the most hands-on stories in open source computing.

We begin with the early days of System76, where Carl shares what it was like to ship Linux hardware when driver support was shaky and installing an OS meant burning CDs. His focus on delivering a seamless out-of-box experience and supporting users directly helped System76 stand out in a time when Linux on laptops was far from a given.

The conversation really picks up as we talk about System76's move into manufacturing. Carl explains how and why they decided to build their own factory, and what they've learned from designing everything from the chassis to the firmware. We get into supply chain complexity, the challenges of BIOS-level access, and the value of having full visibility into what goes into your hardware.

On the software side, we talk about the evolution from Ubuntu to POP!_OS, and how feedback from users shaped its development. Carl also shares the thinking behind Cosmic, their new desktop environment written in Rust, which is built to be modular and deeply customizable. His approach to user experience, design flexibility, and upstream contributions reflects a strong balance of engineering discipline and community focus.

What really stands out is how System76 blends idealism with pragmatism. Carl talks about what it means to stay open in a world full of proprietary barriers, how they navigate licensing, and why they're committed to making computers more auditable, secure, and user-owned.

If you're curious about how a small team can take on hardware, firmware, and software while staying true to open source values, this episode is for you. Carl brings a rare mix of vision, clarity, and hands-on experience that makes this a compelling listen for anyone building in public.
