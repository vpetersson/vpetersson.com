    In this episode, I sat down with Dustin Kirkland to discuss the critical topic of supply chain security and the innovative work being done at Chainguard. We delved into the concept of zero-CVE containers, exploring how this approach is revolutionizing container security. Dustin shared insights on modern supply chain threats, the importance of software bill of materials (SBOM), and practical strategies for maintaining secure container environments. The conversation covered both the technical challenges and solutions in today's rapidly evolving security landscape.

In this engaging conversation with Dustin Kirkland, we explored the fascinating world of container security and supply chain integrity through the lens of Chainguard's innovative approach. Dustin, with his extensive background spanning IBM, Canonical, Google, and now Chainguard, brings a wealth of experience in open source, security, and enterprise software development.

We began by discussing Chainguard's unique position in the container security landscape. Unlike traditional Linux distributions, Chainguard takes a different approach by focusing on building and maintaining "zero-CVE" containers - container images that are continuously updated to eliminate known vulnerabilities. This involves an impressive automated pipeline that can detect and patch vulnerabilities within hours of upstream fixes becoming available.

A significant portion of our discussion centered around the technical architecture behind Chainguard's container security approach:

* The build system that pulls directly from source repositories rather than using pre-built binaries
* Their unique approach to package management using APK format
* The automated vulnerability remediation process that exceeds FedRAMP standards
* The implementation of software bill of materials (SBOM) for complete transparency
* The use of Sigstore and Cosign for container signing and verification

We also delved into the challenges of maintaining rolling releases versus static releases, particularly in enterprise environments. Dustin shared valuable insights about how Chainguard manages to provide both security and stability through their approach of continuous updates rather than periodic major upgrades.

The conversation took an interesting turn when we discussed open source sustainability and the evolution of business models around open source software. Dustin shared his perspective on how the industry has matured from the early days of Linux to today's cloud-native landscape.

Some key takeaways from our discussion:

1. The importance of proactive security measures in container environments
2. How automated tooling can dramatically reduce the time to patch vulnerabilities
3. The role of SBOMs in modern software supply chain security
4. The balance between security, stability, and usability in container images
5. The evolution of open source business models and sustainability

For developers and platform engineers interested in learning more about Chainguard's approach, Dustin recommended visiting [images.chainguard.dev](https://images.chainguard.dev) where you can explore their public container registry and documentation.

This episode provides valuable insights for anyone interested in container security, supply chain integrity, or the evolution of secure software delivery in the cloud-native era.
