In this enlightening episode of "Nerding Out with Viktor," we're joined by the esteemed Liz Rice, a renowned security geek and open source advocate with a deep passion for eBPF. Liz shares her journey from the early days in the London Kubernetes scene to becoming a leading voice in the eBPF community, shedding light on the evolution of eBPF from a packet filtering tool to a powerful kernel programming technology.

Diving into the technical depths, Liz explains how eBPF allows for dynamic kernel behavior modifications, offering insights into its applications in observability, security, and networking. With real-world examples, including its pivotal role at companies like Netflix and Meta, Liz demonstrates eBPF's ability to handle massive scale operations and its impact on the future of infrastructure.

The conversation also explores the acquisition of Isovalent by Cisco, discussing the implications for the eBPF ecosystem and Isovalent's continued commitment to open source. Liz and ViKtor touch on critical topics like runtime security, the importance of runtime security over traditional antivirus solutions, and the challenges of supply chain security in the open-source domain. They also delve into compliance issues in regulated industries, showcasing how eBPF can meet stringent security requirements without compromising on innovation.
