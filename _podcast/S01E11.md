In this episode, I'm joined by Liz Rice, a security expert and open-source advocate, for a deep dive into the fascinating world of eBPF. Liz's expertise in kernel programming and security offers unique insights into how this technology is reshaping modern infrastructure.

We start by breaking down what eBPF actually is - dynamic programming of the Linux kernel to alter its behavior. What particularly caught my attention was how this technology has evolved far beyond its original purpose of packet filtering. Liz shares her introduction to eBPF through Thomas Graf's presentation on Cilium at DockerCon 2017, while I highlight Brendan Gregg's groundbreaking work at Netflix using eBPF for network diagnostics.

The conversation gets especially interesting when we explore how eBPF is revolutionizing traditional tools like IP tables. Liz explains how eBPF's efficiency makes complex tasks like network policy enforcement and zero-trust networking more achievable in modern cloud-native architectures. Her insights into combining eBPF with tools like WireGuard and IPsec for secure communication reveal the practical implications for modern infrastructure.

I was particularly intrigued by our discussion of Tetragon, a Cilium project that leverages eBPF for runtime security. Liz's explanation of how it enables real-time, low-overhead monitoring and threat response showcases the practical applications of this technology. We also tackle recent supply chain security challenges, like the Log4j vulnerability, exploring how eBPF-based tools can adapt quickly to emerging threats.

If you're interested in infrastructure security, kernel programming, or the future of cloud-native technologies, you'll find plenty of practical insights here. Liz brings both deep technical knowledge and practical experience to the discussion, making complex kernel concepts accessible while maintaining their technical depth.
