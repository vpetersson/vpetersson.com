In this episode, I'm joined by Luke Marsden to explore the practical side of AI deployment and his work on Helix. Luke brings deep expertise in making AI accessible and secure for businesses, and I was particularly interested in his approach to open-source AI solutions.

We start with a clear breakdown of large language models (LLMs), with Luke explaining their core concepts in practical terms. What really caught my attention was his perspective on the evolution from research curiosity to practical business tool, especially following ChatGPT's impact on the industry.

The conversation gets particularly interesting when we dive into the open-source versus proprietary AI debate. Luke makes a compelling case for open-source models like Meta's LLaMA and Mistral, explaining how they're catching up to proprietary solutions while offering better control over data privacy - a crucial concern for many businesses.

I especially enjoyed our hands-on demo of Helix, where Luke shows how businesses can deploy and manage AI models on their own infrastructure. We explore everything from creating custom chatbots to integrating AI with existing systems, all while maintaining data privacy and control. The platform's ability to run entirely on local infrastructure or cloud-based GPUs demonstrates a practical solution to a common business challenge.

If you're interested in implementing AI in your organization, particularly with a focus on security and control, you'll find plenty of practical insights here. Luke brings both technical depth and real-world experience to the discussion, making complex AI concepts accessible without losing their technical substance.
