In this episode, I talk with Vlad Trifa, founder of Zimt and co-founder of EVRYTHNG (bought by Digimarc), about the challenges of applying Web3, crypto, and blockchain in real-world systems.

With a background in IoT, supply chain tracking, and digital product identity, Vlad shares practical lessons from working on blockchain projects outside of the lab. We discuss what often goes wrong when these technologies are used in enterprise environments, and where they might still be useful if done right.

Topics covered include:

- Why many blockchain projects would be better off using a database
- The disconnect between crypto culture and enterprise software expectations
- What DAOs are designed to do, and why they often fail
- How tokenomics influences system behavior and project outcomes
- The problems with wallet UX and self-custody for regular users
- Practical use cases for NFTs beyond digital art
- What decentralization actually means for users and developers
- The technical and operational limits of current blockchain infrastructure

Vlad also talks about his work building blockchain systems for supply chains, how upcoming regulations like the EU Cyber Resilience Act may affect the space, and what kind of changes are needed for Web3 to be more reliable and useful.

You'll also hear:

- Why crypto infrastructure is still hard to scale and secure
- How token distribution often leads to trust and governance issues
- What Web3 can learn from open source and traditional software development
- Where blockchain, IoT, and AI might start to overlap in the future

This episode is for developers, product teams, and anyone trying to understand where Web3 stands today, and what needs to happen for it to move forward.
