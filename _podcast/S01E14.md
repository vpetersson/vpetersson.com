In this episode, I'm joined by Christian Walter from 9Elements for a deep dive into firmware security. As the leader of their firmware development department and a key figure in the Open Source Firmware Foundation, Christian brings unique insights into the challenges and innovations in firmware security.

We begin by exploring recent high-profile vulnerabilities like LogoFail and PixiFail. What particularly caught my attention was Christian's technical breakdown of these issues and their broader implications for system security. His explanation of how these vulnerabilities work reveals the complex challenges we face in securing firmware.

The conversation gets especially interesting when we discuss BIOS security. Christian shares fascinating insights about code base reuse across vendors and the challenges in auditing firmware. I was particularly struck by his revelations about the lengthy disclosure periods for firmware vulnerabilities and what this means for system security.

We dive deep into Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs), with Christian explaining different types and their security implications. His disclosure about how attackers could unseal Intel TPMs by reassigning pins from user space was eye-opening. We also explore 9Elements' innovative Firmware CI project, which aims to modernize firmware testing and validation.

If you're interested in hardware security, firmware development, or system architecture, you'll find plenty of practical insights here. Christian brings both deep technical knowledge and practical experience, making complex firmware concepts accessible while maintaining their technical depth.
