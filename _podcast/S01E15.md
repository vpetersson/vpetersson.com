Welcome to this fascinating episode of "Nerding Out with Viktor," where our host, Viktor Petersson, engages in an enlightening conversation with Bryan Cantrill, a renowned CTO and co-founder of Oxide Computer Company. This insightful discussion delves into the evolution of computing technology, shedding light on the future of cloud infrastructure.

Bryan's incredible journey within the field of computing is a testament to his dedication and innovative spirit. Starting from his groundbreaking work on DTrace at Sun Microsystems, he shares his frustrations with the limitations of system observability at that time. This led him to develop DTrace, a pioneering project that allowed for dynamic instrumentation of running systems. By focusing on observing rather than modifying systems, DTrace provided a safer and less invasive way to understand system behavior.

The conversation seamlessly transitions into Bryan's experiences after Sun Microsystems, where he faced the practical challenges of operating a public cloud on commodity hardware during his time at Joyent. This period was crucial in shaping his understanding of the limitations and potential of cloud infrastructure. He details the innovative bets Joyent made, such as OS-based virtualization with zones and their adoption of open-source technologies like OpenSolaris.

The conversation then shifts to Bryan's endeavors at Oxide Computer Company, where he is on a mission to revolutionize cloud infrastructure. The company integrates hardware and software design to offer a holistic solution that ensures efficiency and flexibility. Bryan delves into the innovative design choices made by Oxide, such as utilizing larger fans for better cooling and efficiency and developing their own service processors and operating systems.

In the final segment of our conversation, Viktor and Bryan discuss the broader trends in cloud computing. With the slowing down of Moore's Law, Bryan argues for the economic and practical benefits of owning infrastructure versus renting it from public cloud providers. He emphasizes the importance of modern, scalable, and efficient computing solutions that can be deployed both in the cloud and on-premises.

Throughout this episode, Viktor skillfully guides the conversation, extracting valuable insights and thought-provoking discussions from Bryan's vast experience.
