In this episode, I'm joined by Bryan Cantrill, CTO and co-founder of Oxide Computer Company, for a deep dive into the evolution of computing technology. Bryan's journey from developing DTrace to reimagining cloud infrastructure offers fascinating insights into where our industry has been and where it's heading.

We start with Bryan's groundbreaking work on DTrace at Sun Microsystems. What really caught my attention was his frustration with system observability limitations and how it drove him to develop a solution that could instrument running systems without modifying them. This approach to problem-solving - focusing on observation rather than modification - has influenced system design ever since.

The conversation gets particularly interesting when Bryan shares his experiences running a public cloud on commodity hardware at Joyent. His insights into the practical challenges they faced, from OS-based virtualization with zones to adopting OpenSolaris, reveal the real complexities of building cloud infrastructure. These experiences clearly shaped his current work at Oxide.

I was fascinated by Bryan's explanation of Oxide's integrated approach to hardware and software design. We explore their innovative choices, from larger fans for better cooling to developing custom service processors and operating systems. Bryan's perspective on the economic implications of the Moore's Law slowdown, particularly regarding infrastructure ownership versus rental, offers valuable insights for anyone planning their computing strategy.

If you're interested in system design, cloud infrastructure, or the future of computing, you'll find plenty of practical insights here. Bryan brings decades of experience and a unique perspective on how integrated hardware-software solutions could reshape enterprise computing.
