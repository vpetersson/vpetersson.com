In this episode of "Nerding Out With Viktor," I sit down with Chris Fabian, co-founder of Giga, a groundbreaking project aimed at connecting every school in the world to the internet. Chris's extensive career at UNICEF and his focus on leveraging technology for global good set the stage for this ambitious initiative. Giga, which started about four years ago, tackles the staggering statistic that approximately 70% of schools worldwide are still disconnected from the internet.

Chris shares his journey, from establishing internet service providers in East Africa to driving innovation at UNICEF, where he helped launch the first public sector crypto fund and a venture capital-like fund for tech solutions in emerging markets. These experiences highlighted the critical need for widespread internet access to support digital development, leading to the creation of Giga.

We explore Giga's approach, which involves mapping schools using open-source machine learning and satellite imagery. This process has uncovered significant gaps in existing government data and is essential for understanding the true scale of the connectivity challenge. So far, Giga has mapped about 2.1 million schools, providing invaluable insights into where the need for internet access is most urgent.

Chris explains how Giga also determines the real-time internet connectivity of schools by using a mix of government data and software probes installed in schools. This data is crucial for making informed decisions and advocating for effective connectivity solutions.

We discuss the economic and educational impact of school connectivity, with Chris citing a report that shows increasing school connectivity can significantly boost years of schooling and GDP per capita. He also emphasizes the role of blockchain technology in Giga's vision, seeing schools as nodes in a decentralized network that can support not only educational services but also financial inclusion.

Our conversation touches on the various technological aspects of connectivity, including the roles of fiber, radio, and satellites, as well as the regulatory challenges and the potential of open-source solutions to disrupt monopolistic practices in the telecom industry.

Chris also expresses concerns about initiatives like Facebook's Internet.org, which create walled gardens rather than offering true internet access. He stresses the importance of open access and fair pricing in internet provision, ensuring that all users can benefit from the full potential of the web.

We wrap up the interview with Chris reflecting on the evolution of the internet from its early days to its current state, particularly its potential dangers for young users and the shift towards mobile devices as the primary form of internet access. He reiterates the importance of data, open-source solutions, and regulatory support in achieving equitable and widespread internet access through initiatives like Giga.

This episode offers an in-depth look at the challenges and opportunities in global connectivity, highlighting the transformative power of projects like Giga in bridging the digital divide.
