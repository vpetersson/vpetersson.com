In this comprehensive episode of "Nerding Out with Viktor," I dive into the intricate world of coreboot, a leading open-source BIOS technology. Joining me are Matt DeVillier, also known as Mr. Chromebox, renowned for his contributions to coreboot, first as a community member and later professionally at Purism and AMD, and David Hendricks, a seasoned expert with experience at major tech companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon.

David sets the stage by recalling his initial foray into coreboot during his internship with project founder Ron Minnich. He shares his experiences at Los Alamos National Lab and his pivotal role as the first firmware engineer for Google’s Chrome OS team. Matt shares his journey from a hardware enthusiast to becoming a notable figure in the coreboot community, particularly focusing on x86-based Chrome OS devices.

We delve deep into the mechanics and significance of coreboot, contrasting it with U-Boot and highlighting its varied applications, particularly in Chromebooks and server environments.

A significant part of our discussion focuses on security within BIOS technology. We talk about Secure Boot, differentiate between Google’s verified boot and UEFI Secure Boot, and emphasize the importance of BIOS control for robust security. We also examine critical BIOS vulnerabilities like LogoFail and PixieFail, underscoring their impact on the security landscape.

Supply chain security emerges as a key topic, with discussions around the importance of transparency and control in the firmware development process. We delve into Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) and their role in ensuring firmware integrity and trust, reflecting coreboot’s commitment to supply chain security.

For organizations considering a transition to coreboot, we illuminate the challenges and steps involved, emphasizing the need for early engagement with ODMs and the value of consulting services. We also explore the potential of RISC-V in the open hardware field and coreboot’s involvement in this evolving area.

Matt and David wrap up the episode with insights into the circular economy and coreboot’s role in extending the lifespan of hardware. We discuss its importance in developing countries and sustainable computing practices.

This episode of "Nerding Out with Viktor" offers a thorough understanding of coreboot, its impact on technology, its crucial role in BIOS security and supply chain integrity, and a vision for the future of BIOS technology and open-source firmware development.
