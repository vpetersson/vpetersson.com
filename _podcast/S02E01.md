    In my conversation with Kate Stewart and Gary O'Neall, we explore the evolution and impact of SPDX in software transparency. From its origins in license compliance to its current role in security and vulnerability tracking, we unpack how this open standard is shaping modern software development practices. The discussion reveals fascinating insights into SBOM generation challenges and how SPDX 3.0 is being designed to meet the demands of today's CI/CD environments.

In this episode, I speak with Kate Stewart from the Linux Foundation and Gary O'Neall, a long-time SPDX contributor, about the evolution of SPDX and its role in software transparency. We discuss how SPDX started as a tool for tracking open-source license compliance and continues to address broader needs in security and vulnerability management.

Kate and Gary walked through the technical challenges teams face when generating accurate SBOMs, including handling circular dependencies and dealing with uncertainty in software components. They shared practical examples from their work with various organizations and explained how these challenges influenced the development of SPDX tools and specifications.

We explored current efforts to integrate SBOM generation into build systems, looking at specific examples from the [Zephyr](https://www.zephyrproject.org/) and [Yocto](https://www.yoctoproject.org/) projects. The discussion covered ongoing work to implement build-time SBOM generation for the Linux kernel, highlighting both the technical approach and its practical benefits for development teams.

The conversation then turned to the growing regulatory requirements around SBOMs, particularly in safety-critical systems. Kate and Gary explained how SPDX 3.0 is being developed to handle these requirements while supporting modern CI/CD pipelines. They described the technical considerations behind maintaining compatibility with existing tools while adding features for new use cases.

SPDX remains an open, community-driven project that continues to evolve with industry needs. Whether you're dealing with compliance, security vulnerabilities, or supply chain transparency, this episode provides concrete insights into how SPDX can help address these challenges in your software development workflow.
