        Viktor’s entrepreneurial spirit ignited during his college years, driven by his geeky fascination with computers and security. His first significant venture, YippieMove, was an innovative email migration service that showcased his ability to master complex technological challenges. Establishing a remote-only model at YippieMove, Viktor embraced the flexibility and scalability it offered, allowing his team to thrive in a digital world.
