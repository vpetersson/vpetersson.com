        My journey into tech entrepreneurship started during my college years, fueled by an obsession with computers and security. I launched YippieMove, an email migration service that tackled the complex challenge of moving data between email providers. From day one, I built it as a remote-first company, giving us the flexibility to hire the best talent regardless of location.

      <p class="text-lg mb-3">
        After YippieMove, I created Blotter, a productivity app for macOS that I bootstrapped from scratch. The app resonated with users immediately, climbing to the top 10 in the Mac App Store and teaching me valuable lessons about product-market fit and user experience.

      <p class="text-lg mb-3">
        I dove deep into cloud computing early on, working closely with major cloud providers and becoming an early adopter of containerization with Docker and Kubernetes. My hands-on experience with DevSecOps and security has led me to advise companies and speak at industry events, sharing practical insights from the trenches.

      <p class="text-lg mb-3">
        My biggest venture has been Screenly, which started with Anthias - now the most popular open-source digital signage solution on GitHub. Building on that foundation, I've grown Screenly into a comprehensive digital signage platform used by organizations like NASA, Lowe's, and Capital One. When I'm not coding or building products, I'm sharing my experiences through my blog and podcast, aiming to help others navigate the intersection of technology and entrepreneurship.
