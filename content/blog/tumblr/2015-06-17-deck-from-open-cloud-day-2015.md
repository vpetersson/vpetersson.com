Yesterday I had the pleaseure to speak at [Open Cloud Day](http://www.ch-open.ch/events/aktuelle-events/160615-open-cloud-day-2015/) in Bern, Switzerland.

The linup for the event was good and I’m happy to contribute to the thriving open source and tech community in Switzerland. It was also great to hang out with the fine folks over at [ICCLAB](http://www.s-i.ch/) and [ZHAW](http://www.unibe.ch/).

**Update:** The recording of the talk is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHdc3f98Kxs&index=11&list=PLofS3lNZckseu0v_CP4XjgDUQxRKfF6gA)
