[Are they using Google Apps?](http://aretheyusinggoogleapps.com/)

Google Hangouts is great tool for video conferences…if the other party is also on the Google stack (Gmail or Google Apps). If they’re not, it it’s a dead end.

Often time when scheduling conference calls, I ended up manually looking at the MX records to determine if I should use Google Hangout or [Uber Conference](https://www.uberconference.com/). Since this process got old quickly, I hacked together a quick webapp that can do the lookup.
