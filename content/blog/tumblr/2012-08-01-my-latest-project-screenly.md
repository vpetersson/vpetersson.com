One of the most hyped pieces of hardware in recent time is the [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/). It is hyped for a very good reason. For $35 you get a fully functioning Linux-computer which is about the size of a deck of cards. While there have been plenty of micro-computers around in the past, none at this extremely low price point. The Raspberry Pi is simply any DIY’ers wet dream.

After months of wait, I finally got mine a few weeks back. My first project was **Screenly: A digital signage platform built for the Raspberry Pi**.

While still in early beta, the Screenly is fully functional and [available on Github](https://github.com/wireload/screenly-ose) for anyone to download and install.

The entire system is designed to be a ‘set and forget’-appliance. Once installed, you manage the content from your web browser on your local computer.

Here’s a video of an early version of Screenly in action:

There are also screenshots and photos available of Screenly [here](https://picasaweb.google.com/102112347693505491575/Screenly01?authkey=Gv1sRgCNa2qp-j5vWUGQ).
