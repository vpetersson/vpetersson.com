    Marcelo Garcia, telecom infrastructure veteran turned extreme biohacker, joins me to open Season 3 of Nerding Out with Viktor. From completing a 50-day water-only fast while hiking nearly 1,000 kilometers across Spain to detailed biometric tracking with DEXA scans, VO2 max testing, and continuous glucose monitoring, Marcelo applies engineering discipline to human physiology, treating the body as a system you can stress test, instrument, and optimize.

What happens when you deliberately stress test your own operating system? In this Season 3 opener, I'm joined by Marcelo Garcia, a telecom infrastructure veteran turned extreme biohacker, to explore what it looks like when engineering discipline meets human physiology. Marcelo recently completed a 50-day water-only fast while hiking nearly 1,000 kilometers across Spain, capturing detailed biometric data across DEXA scans, VO2 max testing, HRV tracking, metabolic panels, and continuous glucose monitoring.

Marcelo's background in infrastructure shapes how he approaches the body. He treats physiology the way we treat systems: define constraints, introduce load, measure response, iterate. The 50-day fast was not about spectacle. It was about testing fat oxidation limits, understanding muscle preservation under sustained movement, and identifying where real physiological bottlenecks appear. One key insight is that movement during fasting changes the signal entirely. If the body is not eating but still moving, it adapts differently than if it's simply at rest.

We dig into the mechanics behind prolonged fasting, from ketosis and gluconeogenesis to autophagy and immune regeneration. Beyond the metabolic layer, we explore biological age modeling and how tools like DEXA scans, metabolic carts, and wearable data can now be combined with AI to synthesize over a hundred biomarkers into healthspan projections. The recurring theme throughout is feedback loops. You cannot optimize what you do not instrument.

At its core, this conversation is about endogenous biohacking: not adding more tools, but reactivating built-in systems through controlled stress. For builders and technically inclined listeners, this episode reframes resilience as something you design, measure, and refine, just like any other system you care about.
