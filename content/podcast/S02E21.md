    What happens when long-lifecycle hardware meets modern cybersecurity expectations? In this episode of Nerding Out with Viktor, we're joined by Sarah Fluchs, CTO and OT cybersecurity expert, to break down how the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) is shifting the way secure products are built, maintained, and supported across the EU market. With first-hand involvement in the EU Commission's CRA expert group, Sarah brings a rare blend of technical and policy perspective to an issue that touches every device manufacturer.

What happens when long-lifecycle hardware meets modern cybersecurity expectations? In this episode of Nerding Out with Viktor, I sit down with Sarah Fluchs, CTO and OT cybersecurity expert, to break down how the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) is shifting the way secure products are built, maintained, and supported across the EU market.

Sarah began her career as a mechanical and process engineer before moving into OT security, eventually earning a PhD in security-by-design. Her research intersected directly with the early drafts of the CRA, which led to her appointment on the EU Commission's CRA expert group. That first-hand involvement gives her a rare blend of technical and policy perspective on a piece of legislation that touches every device manufacturer.

As the conversation unfolds, we explore the friction between CRA's security goals and the practical realities of embedded systems. From OTA update limitations to certification constraints, Sarah outlines the challenges manufacturers face and how they're adapting. We dig into why "patch it fast" doesn't scale in OT environments, and how CRA's five-year support requirement forces companies to rethink lifecycle planning from the ground up.

The discussion also turns to SBOMs: what they are, why they matter, and the very real difficulty of generating them in legacy systems. Along the way, we touch on tooling, data quality, versioning, and the operational mess behind making software components traceable and auditable across complex supply chains.

Underlying it all is a simple message: CRA compliance isn't about ticking boxes. Done right, it's a path to stronger engineering practices, deeper supply chain accountability, and better product security. For anyone building secure, connected devices in a regulated world, this episode offers a practical guide to what's coming and how to prepare.
