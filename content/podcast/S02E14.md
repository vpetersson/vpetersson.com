    I'm joined by Niklas Düster, co-lead of OWASP Dependency Track, to explore how teams manage software bill of materials (SBOMs) at scale. From solving vulnerability scan overload to becoming a project co-lead alongside Steve Springett, Niklas shares how Dependency Track enables continuous visibility across thousands of components.

Niklas Düster got involved with [Dependency Track](https://dependencytrack.org/) the way many great open source stories begin: by trying to solve a problem at work. As a security engineer, he was drowning in vulnerability scan reports that didn't scale. When he discovered Dependency Track and CycloneDX, he not only adopted them but began contributing, eventually becoming the project's co-lead alongside Steve Springett.

In this conversation, Niklas walks us through how Dependency Track helps teams stay on top of their software bill of materials (SBOMs), enabling continuous visibility across thousands of components. We dig into real-world workflows, from uploading SBOMs in CI/CD pipelines to responding quickly during incidents like Log4Shell and how version 5 of the platform is evolving to support horizontal scaling, smarter suppression logic, and role-based access control.

He also breaks down how teams use VEX files to add context to vulnerabilities, why gating deployments can backfire, and how CEL-based policy conditions offer a more flexible way to manage findings. The goal isn't just to scan for issues, but to track them intelligently across the full software lifecycle.

Underlying it all is a clear philosophy: prioritize usability, support real engineering workflows, and keep the system lean enough that newcomers can adopt it without needing a Kafka cluster. Niklas's focus is on making open source tooling that actually works in production, not just in theory.
