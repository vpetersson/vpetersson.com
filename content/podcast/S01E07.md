In this episode, I'm joined by Matt DeVillier (Mr. Chromebox) and David Hendricks to explore the fascinating world of coreboot. Their combined experience from companies like AMD, Facebook, Google, and Amazon offers unique insights into how this open-source BIOS technology is transforming firmware development.

We start with Matt's journey from hardware enthusiast to coreboot expert, and David's early work with project founder Ron Minnich. What particularly caught my attention was the contrast between coreboot and U-Boot, especially in how they're used in Chromebooks and servers. Their explanations of Secure Boot, verified boot, and UEFI Secure Boot reveal the critical role BIOS plays in system security.

The conversation gets especially interesting when we dive into recent BIOS vulnerabilities like LogoFail and PixieFail. Matt and David share candid insights about supply chain security and the importance of transparency in firmware development. Their discussion of Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) highlights how crucial firmware integrity has become in modern computing.

I was particularly intrigued by our discussion about transitioning to coreboot. Their emphasis on early engagement with Original Design Manufacturers (ODMs) and the potential of RISC-V shows both the challenges and opportunities in open hardware. We also explore how coreboot contributes to sustainable computing, especially in developing countries.
