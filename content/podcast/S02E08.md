In this deep-dive conversation, I sit down with Kevin Henrikson to explore what it really takes to scale technical teams, ship faster, and survive the transition from startup chaos to operating at enterprise scale.

Drawing on his experience across Zimbra, Microsoft, and Instacart, Kevin shares lessons that most startup founders only learn the hard way. From being turned down for a coding role and later managing the team that rejected him, to leading engineering through acquisitions and hypergrowth, he breaks down how systems, structure, and culture evolve when a company goes from 10 people to 1500.

We get into the operational and cultural challenges behind some of the most common startup transitions:

- Why acquisitions often fail due to "organ rejection" and how to avoid it
- What changes when a founder becomes an advisor inside a large org
- How a simple Friday shipping cadence transformed Outlook Mobile's engineering culture
- Why scaling isn't just about hiring, it's about systematizing decision-making and trust
- What breaks first when demand suddenly explodes, as it did at Instacart during COVID

Kevin also shares his approach to buying SaaS companies and applying AI and automation to operate them more efficiently with fewer people and more resilience.

We also cover:

- The real role of a CTO at scale (hint: it's mostly not about tech)
- How to build teams across geographies without creating silos
- Why code, not people, should define your infrastructure and processes
- The value of having a clear North Star in operational decision-making

The episode closes with a look at how systems thinking and automation are reshaping what's possible in modern engineering orgs and what founders should pay attention to before things start to break.

Whether you're a technical founder, CTO, or operator building your first team or scaling your fifth, this conversation is full of practical insight from someone who's been through every stage.
