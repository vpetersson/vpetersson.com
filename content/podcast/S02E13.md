    I'm joined by Thorbjørn Rønje, founder of Bifrost Studios, to discuss why venture studios are the most effective path to building companies. Drawing from nearly 50 startups, he shows how repeatable systems beat lone heroics when launching new products.

Thorbjørn started with a simple insight: traditional entrepreneurship is inefficient. Too much learning happens on the fly, wasting time and capital. In this conversation, he explains how the venture studio approach de-risks the early phases by codifying what works, from building teams to finding product-market fit.

We dig into Bifrost's "Purple Ocean" framework for selecting ideas, their rapid product validation process, and why the studio hands off each project once it's ready to scale. It's a model designed for speed, clarity, and capital efficiency.

Thorbjørn also shares how these playbooks apply to acquisitions, reviving legacy businesses using the same systems and technology. Underpinning it all is a practical philosophy: build what users need, test quickly, and avoid unnecessary complexity.

We wrap up by looking ahead at how AI and post-labor economics might reshape company building, ownership, and income distribution.
