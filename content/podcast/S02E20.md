    What happens when a government's push for "safety" starts reshaping the architecture of the internet? In this episode of Nerding Out with Viktor, we're joined by James Baker, Policy and Campaigns Manager at Open Rights Group, to unpack the deeper implications of the UK Online Safety Act and the country's evolving approach to Digital ID. With two decades of work in privacy advocacy, James offers a grounded but no less urgent perspective on how these policies affect builders, platforms, and users alike.

What happens when a government's push for "safety" starts reshaping the architecture of the internet? In this episode of Nerding Out with Viktor, I'm joined by James Baker, Policy and Campaigns Manager at [Open Rights Group](https://www.openrightsgroup.org/), to unpack the deeper implications of the UK Online Safety Act and the country's evolving approach to Digital ID. With two decades of work in privacy advocacy, James offers a grounded but no less urgent perspective on how these policies affect builders, platforms, and users alike. What begins as a conversation about compliance quickly leads into bigger questions about identity, control, and the future of privacy in digital systems.

James began his work in digital rights in the early 2000s with the NO2ID campaign, helping defeat the UK's first national ID card proposal. Since then, he's worked across local government, EU institutions, and privacy advocacy, now leading policy at Open Rights Group — often described as the UK's EFF. That long view shapes his critique of today's Digital ID and surveillance proposals, where control over identity is quietly shifting away from individuals.

As James explains, many concerns around Digital ID in the UK aren't rooted in the technology itself but in how it's governed. Unlike decentralized or bank-issued identity systems seen in countries like Sweden and Estonia, the UK model leans heavily toward centralization. That raises alarms about a so-called "Database State," where access to public services could be controlled, revoked, or surveilled at scale. Combine that with AI-driven policy decisions and the involvement of players like Palantir, and you have a potent recipe for institutional overreach without the constitutional safeguards seen in other democracies.

Throughout the episode, we dive into the technical consequences of these policy shifts. From mandated age verification to perceptual hash matching and metadata scanning, the requirements of the Online Safety Act place growing burdens on infrastructure teams. As James puts it, the UK's enforcement model risks fragmenting the open internet, pushing developers toward compliance-heavy centralization or forcing them to exit the UK market altogether. Even tools like end-to-end encryption and VPNs are under quiet pressure, with the line between user protection and mass surveillance getting harder to draw.

What emerges isn't just a policy critique. It's a design problem. James outlines what a privacy-first digital ID could look like: built on W3C standards, backed by legal protections, open source, and decentralizable by design. It's a vision that trusts the user instead of defaulting to control. And while he's cautious about political will, he's optimistic that builders can still shape a better way forward, especially when armed with the right tools and a clear understanding of what's at stake.

If you care about open source, encryption, or building systems that scale responsibly, this is an episode you'll want to catch.
