How do you design and ship coreboot and Linux hardware that actually works in the real world? In this episode of Nerding Out with Viktor, I sit down with Sean Rhodes, Firmware Engineer at Star Labs, to explore what it takes to build Linux-first laptops and mini PCs backed by open firmware.

Sean reflects on the early days of Star Labs, when a handful of engineers set out to create laptops that ran Linux reliably. What began as a side project grew into a full-fledged company with a reputation for supporting open source systems. Along the way, the team faced high tooling costs, unpredictable supply chains, and the challenge of meeting the needs of a niche but demanding user base.

As the conversation unfolds, Sean details how Star Labs survived the COVID-era supply chain crisis, why they moved away from AMI BIOS in favor of coreboot, and how firmware updates delivered through LVFS became central to their long-term reliability strategy. He also explains why some features, like fingerprint readers, failed to deliver real-world value.

At its core, the Star Labs philosophy is about empowering users with secure, reliable, and open hardware. From haptic trackpads to distro-agnostic support for Fedora, Qubes, and openSUSE, Sean's perspective makes clear that Linux-first machines can thrive outside the mainstream PC market.
