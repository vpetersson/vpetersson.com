Is tech making us smarter—or just more distracted? In this episode of Nerding Out with Viktor, I sit down with Patrick Walker, former YouTube and Facebook executive turned conscious tech founder, to explore how we got here and what it takes to break free from the default.

Patrick's journey spans the early days of digital media, from working as a TV producer in Japan to navigating YouTube's copyright wars and platform expansion across global markets. At Facebook, he witnessed firsthand the ethical friction behind live video, algorithm design, and the psychological toll of attention-based products, especially on younger users.

The conversation dives into the pivotal moments that shaped Patrick's perspective on technology's impact. He reflects on his career spent scaling platforms like YouTube globally, helping define the infrastructure that powers modern video consumption, and eventually making the difficult decision to leave Big Tech behind.

That turning point led to Uptime, a micro-learning app designed to fight passive consumption and offer a smarter way to engage with content. Patrick unpacks the product thinking behind building for digital wellness, explaining how it requires more than just good UX—it demands restraint, values, and long-term perspective in an industry optimized for the opposite.

Whether you're building tech, raising kids around screens, or just trying to regain your focus, this episode offers a practical look at how to design and live with more clarity in an attention-driven world.
