In this episode, I'm joined by Dom Guinard from Digimarc to explore the fascinating world of digital content standards. Dom's extensive experience in IoT and digital standards offers unique insights into how we can protect and authenticate content in an increasingly AI-driven world.

We start with a deep dive into the C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity) standard. What particularly caught my attention was how this technology combines metadata, watermarking, and hardware integration to establish content trustworthiness. Dom's explanation of how these elements work together reveals the complexity of ensuring digital authenticity.

The conversation gets especially interesting when we explore the practical implications of C2PA. Dom breaks down how this standard helps combat deepfakes and unauthorized content use, while also empowering creators with more control over their work. His insights into the recent US executive order on AI and its connection to digital content standards highlight the growing importance of these initiatives.

I was particularly intrigued by our discussion of how C2PA integrates with existing technological ecosystems. Dom's perspective on balancing innovation with content protection shows the careful consideration that goes into developing these standards. We also explore the practical tools available, including Digimarc's C2PA Chrome Extension.
