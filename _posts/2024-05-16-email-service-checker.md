A decade ago, I created "Are They Using Google Apps" to address a simple yet crucial need: determining whether a remote party was using Google Apps (now Google Workspace) to decide if I should send them a Hangout invite for a meeting (or something else). Fast forward to today, and I am thrilled to introduce a revitalized and enhanced version of this concept – [Email Service Checker](https://emailservicechecker.com).

Email Service Checker takes the original idea a step further by providing a comprehensive tool that allows you to determine the email service provider a domain or email address is using. This tool is perfect for sales teams and professionals who need to understand the email stack of their prospects for more targeted and effective outreach.
