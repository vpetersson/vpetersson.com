I've run into the following error myself a number of time in recent time, and just wanted to document the solution for this in case other people run into it too:

Here's the problem:

* You are trying to upgrade your Raspberry Pi to the latest version
* When you upgrade the kernel, it chokes with an error like this:

```
> $ sudo apt upgrade
Reading package lists... Done

```

After wasting far too much time trying to debug this, I found that there was an easy solution: simply remount `/boot`.

```
> $ sudo umount /boot
> $ sudo mount /boot
```

Now, I don't know what the exact root cause is, but it's likely something to do with the fact that `/boot` is mounted as vfat and for whatever reason there is some kind of lock or similar that happens after you've run the device for some time.

In any case, hopefully this saves others the agony of trying to resolve this.
