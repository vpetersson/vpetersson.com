Yesterday I had the pleaseure to speak at [Open Cloud Day](http://www.ch-open.ch/events/aktuelle-events/160615-open-cloud-day-2015/) in Bern, Switzerland.

The linup for the event was good and Iâ€™m happy to contribute to the thriving open source and tech community in Switzerland. It was also great to hang out with the fine folks over at [ICCLAB](http://www.s-i.ch/) and [ZHAW](http://www.unibe.ch/).

**Update:** The recording of the talk is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHdc3f98Kxs&index=11&list=PLofS3lNZckseu0v_CP4XjgDUQxRKfF6gA)
