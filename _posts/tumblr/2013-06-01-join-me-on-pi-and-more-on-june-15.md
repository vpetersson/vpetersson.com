On June 15 I will be speaking at Pi and More in at Trier University in Germany.

The event is all about Raspberry Pi, and Iâ€™m really excited to be part of the event.

My presentation will be about Screenly and how we built the most popular digital signage solution for the Raspberry Pi thanks to the awesome Raspberry Pi community.

You can read more about the event [here](http://www.piandmore.de/) (German). The event is free to attend, and you can sign up [here](https://piandmore3.eventbrite.de/).

See you there!
