A while back, I stumbled across [NomadList](http://nomadlist.io/). It’s basically a crowd sourced list of cities around the world ranked by how good they are for remote working.

That got me thinking. One of the pain points I’ve had over the years when traveling is finding the best local mobile carrier for pre-paid cards. Wouldn’t it be great if there was a crowd sourced database for this?

So I spent some time yesterday hacking together a rough prototype for this that I call [NomadSIMs](http://nomadsims.io/).

The page source is available on Github, and the database is simple JSON. Anyone can help contribute to the list by just issuing a pull request.

I’ve already populated the database with some data I had readily available, but really need help from other travelers/digital nomads out there.

Let’s build out this list and make it awesome!
