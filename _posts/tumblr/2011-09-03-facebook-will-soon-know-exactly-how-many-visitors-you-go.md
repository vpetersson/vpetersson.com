Is it possible that Facebook know more about how many visitors a given website has than Alexa or Hitwise? I’m not talking about people sharing a link on Facebook and then tracking outbound clicks. I’m talking about capturing all visitors. Both Alexa and Hitwise used to both rely on browser-addons to capture this data. Since only a small percentage of users will install this add-on, they will have really rough data (and skewed towards non-technical users).

So how can Facebook then acquire more accurate data than these traditional companies? It’s pretty simple. You know that Like-button that is showing up all over the web these days? Turns out that Facebook is hosting all those images (and you [cannot host this yourself as that is a Term of Service breach](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2011/09/surprise-facebook-doesnt-like-privacy-countermeasures/)).

Since Facebook is hosting all those images, they know exactly (or at least could know) how many visitors you have on your website for each page you got a Like-button. No estimates, but exact up-to-date metrics. If you’re logged into Facebook and visit a site with a Like-icon, they can also track that you have visited.

The bottom line is that Facebook knows a lot more than you might think about the web as a whole.
