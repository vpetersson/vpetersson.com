I’m really excited to let you know that Screenly is featured in the latest issue of Linux User in the U.K. (issue 146). A snippet of the article is already up on their [website](http://www.linuxuser.co.uk/news/win-a-hdmipi-screenly).

We’ve also teamed up with Linux User to give a way a free 12 month subscription of [Screenly](http://www.screenlyapp.com), along with a [HDMIPi](http://hdmipi.com/).
