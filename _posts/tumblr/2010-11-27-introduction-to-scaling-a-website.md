Scaling architecture and web sites is really something I find exciting. I’ve playing with scaling various software for many years, but it is just recent years I’ve come to use this in production (primarily through [YippieMove](http://www.yippiemove.com)).

If you’re curious about scaling your website, I can really recommend the following video lecture from Harvard. It goes though concept that you might have run across in various blog-posts before. It is not super-technical, so even if you’re new to programming etc., you should still be able to understand the entire lecture.
