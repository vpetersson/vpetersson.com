[gSocial](http://gsocialconference.com/) is a conference for Google Apps resellers and ISVs. I attended the event last year, and I was really impressed. I’m back for the conference this year, but I will aslo be giving a talk.

My talk will be on the topic of email migration and what we’ve learned over the years working with [YippieMove](http://www.yippiemove.com/).

The event also happens to have great timing, since we are just about to release YippieMove’s API, and we’d love talk with the bright people at gSocial about it.

The schedule for the event is available [here](http://gsocialconference.com/#57e/custom_plain), and you can register [here](https://events.r20.constantcontact.com/register/eventReg?oeidk=a07e6ckv9sj2f25a775&oseq=).
