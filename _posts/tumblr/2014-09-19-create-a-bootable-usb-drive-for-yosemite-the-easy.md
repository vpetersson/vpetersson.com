Today I decided to take Yosemite for a spin on my old laptop.

Since installing from USB is the only way to do a _clean_ install, I started googling around for exact steps (which were somewhat messy).

To my surprise, it appears as Apple also realized that this was messy and decided to bake in a solution for this. It isnâ€™t however completely obvious, but here is the command:

    $ sudo /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite\ Developer\ Preview.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/your_flash_drive / --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite\ Developer\ Preview.app/

**Protip:** If you want to speed things up, use a Class 10 SD card instead of an USB drive. These cards are faster than most vanilla USB drives, and any modern Mac will boot off of them just fine.
