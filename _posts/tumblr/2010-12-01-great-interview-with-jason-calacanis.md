If you’re into startups and technology, you should really watch the following interview with Jason Calacanis from the Fowa-conference in London. I really like how Jason describes the way he and his team work. I completely agree with him. There is no such thing as ‘balance’ in a startup. You’re either in to do it all the way, or you might as well go home.
