ZoneMinder is a great piece software. It is a very powerful video surveillance tool that can be configured with both IP cameras and regular cameras (via V4L). Unfortunately it is a bit difficult to get up and running with. A while back I needed to deploy ZoneMinder myself for a client. One thing lead to another, and I ended up with a fully working Virtual Machine for ZoneMinder. I uploaded it here just for fun, but it didn’t take long before I had was linked to from the official ZoneMinder project and the visitors started to pour in.

Today I just released version 0.2. It is using the latest LTS version of Ubuntu (10.04) and ZoneMinder 1.24.2. I’ve also reduced the size of the VM significantly. The new version is about 1GB extracted and around 350MB compressed.

For more information about the VM and how to download it, please visit [this page](http://viktorpetersson.com/open-source/zoneminder-virtual-appliance).
