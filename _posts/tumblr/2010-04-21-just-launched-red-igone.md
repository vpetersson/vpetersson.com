Two days ago we launched [Red iGone](http://www.redigone.com) — the easiest way to remove red-eyes out of you photos. It’s a dead-simple tool. Just upload your photo, select the red eye, let Red iGone work its magic, and download the enhanced photo.

It’s fully web-based, and does not require anything else than your web browser. While it is still in beta, it works pretty well (with occasional hick-ups).

Only hours after launching, we had received 20 some tweets, a few hundred unique visitors and two blog-reviews, so I think it is looking pretty promising.

Red iGone is the first product from a new company that I founded with [Stefan Blomqwist](http://www.blomqwist.com/) called Devify.

**Update**: 48 hours after launch, we’ve seen numerous blog posts about Red iGone and over 100 tweets. Not too shabby.
