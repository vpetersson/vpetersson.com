I’m astonished by the amount of traction we’ve been seeing for Screenly. The Open Source-version is growing rapidly in traction, while the wait-list for the Pro-version is growing.

Given the amount of traction, we’ve now allocated more resources from WireLoad towards Screenly. The first priority right now is a cleanup of the code base and to improve the user interface for Screenly OSE.

Since I’ve been receiving a lot of emails from the contact form on my website about Screenly, we felt that it was important to push out a website for Screenly. We’ve now done this, and you can find it at [ScreenlyApp.com](http://www.screenlyapp.com/). On the website, you’ll find more information about Screenly, along with a live-demo of Screenly OSE.
