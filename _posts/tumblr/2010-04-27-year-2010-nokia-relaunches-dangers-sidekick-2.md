The hat is off to Nokia. They’ve managed to stay inside their cave in Finland while the rest of the world evolved. First they tried to sue Apple over some vague copyright infringement, while we all know that it was really just a desperate attempt to get some press. While Nokia once was an innovative cellphone manufacturer, I really don’t know what went wrong. Today Nokia did something remarkable though: They re-launched Danger’s Sidekick 2 under the name N8. Take a look at the similarities after the jump. Well done Nokia. The Sidekick 2 was released in 2002. Eight years later you release the same product. Astonishing.
