[GetCanary.io - Intelligent notifications](http://getcanary.io/)

The other day I had a Eureka moment while archiving the daily batch of notifications from various server tasks. Instead of having to read over ‘success’ messages, why isn’t there a reliable way to instead get notified when things do not work as expected. This is what our latest project sets out to solve. The title of the project is GetCanary.io, and the waitlist is open now.
