I’m excited to announce that we’ve released a major update to Screenly. As you can see in the screenshot above, we’ve given the user interface a major overhaul. The workflow is significantly more streamlined, and a lot prettier.

You can take the new interface for a spin [here](http://ose.demo.screenlyapp.com). For upgrade instructions, please take a look [here](http://www.screenlyapp.com/ose.html#upgrade).

More information about Screenly is available [here](http://www.screenlyapp.com).
