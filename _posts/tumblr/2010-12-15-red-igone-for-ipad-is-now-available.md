I’m really excited about this. [Red iGone](http://www.redigone.com), the red-eye removal tool I’ve been working on for some time, is [now available on the iPad](http://blog.redigone.com/red-igone-for-ipad-now-available).

This is the first iPad application I’ve been working on, and the end-result is pretty awesome. While the web-version works great, the iPad version is far more intuitive, given the intuitive touch experience.
