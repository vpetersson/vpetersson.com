A few weeks ago, I was contacted by [SCU](http://scu.edu/)â€˜s Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (CIE). Apparently I was mentioned in [Santa Clara Magazine](http://www.scu.edu/scm/summer2012/index.cfm) about being featured on TechCrunch.

CIE wanted me to write an article about my background and my experience as an entrepreneur. I was happy to share that with them, and the [article](http://www.scu.edu/business/cie/alumni_and_friends/Viktor-Petersson.cfm) went live today.
