So I’m not 100% confident that this is a scam, but it sure looks like it. I’ve been contacted by this guy a few times by now. Here’s the email he sent out. Also, I’m pretty sure there is no such thing as the “reverse google pagerank algorithm”.

Just thought I’d share it with all of you have in case you have received a similar e-mail. I’m pretty sure neither Matt Cutts nor Rand Fishkin would approve of using the “reverse google pagerank algorithm” even if it did exist. When it comes to SEO, I’m rather safe than sorry and use standard white-hat practices.

**Update**: John Stahl sent me another message today. The exact same message for the fifth time.
