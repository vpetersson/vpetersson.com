If you have nothing booked for August 30th, I suggest you mark it ‘busy’ in your calendar, as that’s the date for [NoSQL Road Show](http://nosqlroadshow.com/) in Basel, Switzerland.

At the event, I will be giving a presentation about MongoDB titled “[MongoDB’s Replica Sets – Painless scaling and High Availability (HA)](http://nosqlroadshow.com/nosql-basel-2012/presentation/MongoDB's%20Replica%20Sets%20-Painless%20scaling%20and%20High%20Availability%20(HA)).”

As the title implies, it is a talk about MongoDB’s Replica Sets. I will demonstrate how easy it is to setup, and also talk about lessons I’ve learned using MongoDB.

Register for the event [here](https://secure.trifork.com/nosql-basel-2012/registration/).
