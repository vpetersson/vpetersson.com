Last night we rolled out a new version of [Chronicle.IM](http://www.chronicle.im) to the production servers. The product is not quite ready yet, but you can sign up with your email address if you want to be invited to the beta-version. Over the next few weeks we will start letting a few beta-testers in. If everything goes well, we will invite more.

So what is [Chronicle.IM](http://www.chronicle.im)? The slogan for the product is ‘Write the story of your life.’ That sums it up pretty well. It is an online journaling/diary app that allows you to keep track of your life in with ease and style. While I don’t want to reveal all the details now, let’s just say that we’ve focused on simplicity and usability. You won’t be disappointed.
