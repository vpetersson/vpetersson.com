[Autojump: blazing fast filesystem navigation](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump)

> autojump - A cd command that learns - easily navigate directories from the command line

I just ran across a very convenient little tool called `autojump` that I wanted to share.

For a number of years, iâ€™ve used aliases in Bash for quickly navigating the file system. `autojump` makes this unnecessary.

# OS X crash course

This requires that you have `brew` installed and use Bash as your shell

## Installation

    brew install autojump
    echo '[[ -s `brew --prefix`/etc/autojump.sh ]] && . `brew --prefix`/etc/autojump.sh' >> ~/.bash_profile 
    source ~/.bash_profile

## Usage

    cd /path/to/my-project
    j my-project

Please note that you need to `cd` into the directory before it appears in the index.
