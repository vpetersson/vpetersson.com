> One of the best ways to ensure your whole team knows what your technology is doing is to ensure that everyone has quick and easy access to your dashboards. One of the best ways to do that is to get your dashboards displayed on a giant screen right in the middle of your work area.

> Sometimes this can be a bit of a pain - you need to devote some machine to power the dashboard and pipe it to the TV as well as the hassle of setting it up. Enter Screenly!
