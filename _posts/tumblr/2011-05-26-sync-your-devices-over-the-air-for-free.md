I hate wires. I particular hate having to use wires to syncing devices.

Luckily, there are ways to avoid them (in most cases). If you are having issues with this, the solution is not to buy MobileMe. Google App/Gmail is all you need. I just posted up an [article](http://blog.yippiemove.com/2011/05/25/how-to-keep-your-contacts-and-calendars-in-sync-across-devices-for-free/) over at the YippieMove Blog that will tell you how. After reading it, you should be able to sync your Mac, iOS device(s) and Android device(s) wirelessly â€” for free.
