[Tor](https://www.torproject.org) is a project that I really love to support. In this age of increased surveillance, Tor is needed more than ever.

Unfortunately, your own Tor Exit Node can put you in a lot of trouble due to the fact that Tor being used for all kinds of abuses. This is unfortunately a the reality of anonymity; some people will abuse it.

Yet, we shall not let this overshadow the fact that Tor is a critical tool for or **a lot** of people out there who are trying to circumvent government censorship. I want to help **these people** with the resources I have available at my disposal. As a result, I have run a number of Tor servers over the years.

If you don’t want to take the risk of running your own Exit Node, you can still help by running a Relay Node. To simplify the deployment of this (and to increase the security of your server), I’ve created a [Docker container](https://github.com/vpetersson/docker-torrelay) that does just that.

With Docker installed, all you need to do is to run the following:

```bash
$ docker run -d \
    -p 9001:9001 \
    -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
    -v /data/tor:/var/lib/tor \
    --name tor-relay \
    vpetersson/tor-relay
```

This will create a Tor Relay Node. All you need to do is to open up your firewall, such that the Docker container is reachable on port 9001.

Update: I just updated the name of the container added more info. Please check the github page for more details.
