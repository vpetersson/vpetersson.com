I recently helped a team migrate their Git repositories from Phabricator to GitHub. While Phabricator was a great tool that combined code reviews, task management, and repository hosting, its official deprecation in 2021 has left many teams looking for alternatives.

While moving directly from Phabricator to Phorge is often the simplest path (here's a [migration guide](https://we.phorge.it/w/why_migrating_from_phabricator_to_phorge/)), some teams prefer to keep their project management in Phabricator/Phorge while leveraging GitHub's CI/CD capabilities. Here's how we handled the Git migration:

### The Migration Process

#### 1. Setting up the GitHub Repository

Start by creating a private, bare repository on GitHub for each repo you want to migrate.

#### 2. Creating a Dedicated Mirroring User

For security reasons, we created a dedicated GitHub user (we called it `foobar-bot`) specifically for repository mirroring. This is better than using personal accounts because:

- It keeps the mirroring credentials separate from personal accounts
- It makes it easier to manage permissions
- It provides better audit trails

The setup involves:

- Creating a new SSH key pair
- Adding the public key to the bot's GitHub account
- Storing the private key in Phabricator's credential store

#### 3. Setting up Repository Access

After creating the bot account, invite it to your private repository with read-only permissions. Important: Make sure to accept the invitation from the bot account itself, or the mirroring won't work.

#### 4. The Actual Migration

Here's the command sequence we used to migrate the repositories:

```bash
git clone --mirror ssh://git@phabricator.mydomain.com/path/to/repo
cd repo.git
git push --mirror git@github.com:MyTeam/repo.git
```

This approach preserves all history, branches, and tags.

#### 5. Configuring Phabricator/Phorge

After the migration, you'll need to update Phabricator/Phorge to observe the GitHub repository:

1. Go to your repository in Phabricator/Phorge
2. Navigate to `Manage` -> `URI`
3. Update the original URI:
   - Set `I/O Type` to **Read Only**
   - Set `Display Type` to **Hidden**
4. Add a new URI:
   - Set `I/O Type` to **Observe**
   - Set `Display Type` to **Visible**
   - Choose **GitHub** under "Credentials" and link it to your bot account

This configuration keeps everything in sync while maintaining proper access controls.

### Edge Cases

One constraint with GitHub that you *may* run into is the file size limit. Due to the way `git` is designed, you can't just *delete* files in the git history without impacting various hashes. More on this can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository).

#### Soft limits

Files over 50MB will yield the following error:

```bash
remote: warning: File [redacted] is 71.46 MB; this is larger than GitHub's recommended maximum file size of 50.00 MB
```

You can still push these files, but it's recommended that you avoid this.

#### Hard limits

This is where it gets tricky. Files exceeding 100MB will outright be rejected with an error like this:

```bash
remote: error: Trace: [redacted]
remote: error: See https://gh.io/lfs for more information.
remote: error: File [redacted] is 260.31 MB; this exceeds GitHub's file size limit of 100.00 MB
remote: error: GH001: Large files detected. You may want to try Git Large File Storage - https://git-lfs.github.com.
To github.com:[redacted].git
```

Now, you need to be careful here and read over the GitHub page linked above. It is *possible* to delete files from the git history, but not without consequences. The most important consequence is that you will be impacting hashes. So for instance, if you've used a hash in your CI/CD pipeline, this will **change** when you take the steps below.

#### Removing files

Once you've understood the consequences, let's go ahead with the solution. First, install [`git-filter-repo`](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo). This is a tool that can help rewrite the git history (and is recommended by GitHub).

With this tool installed, you then need to run `git filter-repo --strip-blobs-bigger-than 100M` on the mirror you cloned. You can also adjust this to `50M` to be safe, but I would opt for minimum changes.

After you've run that command, `git-filter-repo` will create a handy map for you in `filter-repo/commit-map`, which shows the mapping between the old and new hashes.

Finally, you can now push this repo to GitHub using the command we used previously.

### Why This Matters

Phabricator started as a Facebook project and gained popularity for its comprehensive feature set. While Phorge keeps the ecosystem alive, many teams are moving their Git operations to GitHub for better integration with modern development tools.

This hybrid approach lets you keep what works in Phabricator/Phorge while getting GitHub's benefits. It's not about following trendsâ€”it's about making your development workflow more efficient and maintainable.

If you're still using Phabricator or Phorge, now might be a good time to consider this migration. The longer you wait, the more complex it might become.
