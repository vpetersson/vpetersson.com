Generate a short summary for my tech podcast episode that captures both technical depth and personal insight. Write from my perspective (Viktor Petersson) using first person ("I", "we"). Focus on the practical takeaways and real experiences shared in my conversation with the guest. The tone should be direct and personal while maintaining technical accuracy. Avoid time-specific language (like "today", "this week"). Keep it to one short paragraph and include relevant technical keywords. Don't mention the podcast name as that is implicit.
