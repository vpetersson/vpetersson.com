about_summary: I'm a tech entrepreneur who turned my Silicon Valley education into a series of successful bootstrapped ventures. Starting with YippieMove, an email migration service I built during my time at Santa Clara University, I've consistently identified and capitalized on technical opportunities others missed. <br> I've been running remote teams for over a decade, well before it became the norm, and built Blotter, a highly successful productivity app for macOS. <br> <br>Today, I lead Screenly, the world's first developer-friendly digital signage platform that powers over 10,000 screens globally. We also created Anthias, a leading open-source digital signage solution. My focus is on building secure, scalable systems and helping others do the same.
podcast_summary: Join me for deep dives into technology, entrepreneurship, and security. Drawing from my experience building and scaling companies, I explore the intersection of business and technology with fellow entrepreneurs and technical leaders.
