        While primarily focused on running my own companies, I occasionally take on select consulting and advisory engagements where I can make a meaningful impact. I help companies navigate complex technical challenges in cloud architecture, DevSecOps, and remote-first engineering. With over 15 years of hands-on experience building and scaling products, I bring practical insights from running successful SaaS companies and open-source projects. As a co-lead for one of CISA's SBOM tiger teams, I've helped shape the future of software supply chain security.
